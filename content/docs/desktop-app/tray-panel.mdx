<Callout title="This is the product">
  Everything in the onboarding flow exists to get the user here. The tray panel is what they see every day — open the tray, copy a host, connect their IDE, see their services. It should feel instant and obvious.
</Callout>

## Layout

The tray panel has four sections, top to bottom:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ ● Distiller-8X29        ↕    ⚙  │  ← Header
│   Connected · 22ms · 3 tunnels  │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│ ACCESS                           │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ >_ SSH Host                  │ │
│ │ distiller-8x29          [📋]│ │  ← The universal link
│ │                              │ │
│ │ Use this host in any IDE ... │ │
│ └──────────────────────────────┘ │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│ SERVICES                         │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ 🟢 Web Dev (3000)    📋  ↗  │ │
│ │    http://localhost:3000     │ │
│ │──────────────────────────────│ │
│ │ 🟢 API Server (8080) 📋  ↗  │ │
│ │    http://localhost:8080     │ │
│ │──────────────────────────────│ │
│ │ 🟢 PostgreSQL (5432) 📋     │ │
│ │    localhost:5432            │ │
│ └──────────────────────────────┘ │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│ + Add port forward               │  ← Custom tunnel
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Header

```
● Distiller-8X29        ↕    ⚙
  Connected · 22ms · 3 tunnels
```

- **Status dot** — green (connected), yellow (connecting), red (offline), grey (no device)
- **Device name** — clickable, opens device dropdown
- **↕ caret** — subtle indicator that it's a dropdown
- **⚙ gear** — opens settings window (separate window, not in the tray)
- **Status line** — connection state + round-trip latency + active tunnel count

### Device Dropdown

Clicking the device name opens a dropdown:

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ 🟢 Distiller-8X29     ✓ │  ← active
│    distiller-8x29        │
│ ⚫ Distiller-4F01        │  ← offline
│    Offline               │
│──────────────────────────│
│ + Add Device             │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

- Lists all paired devices with status
- Checkmark on the active device
- Switching devices refreshes the panel (new host, new services)
- "Add Device" triggers the pairing flow (from the device pairing screen, not sign-in)
- Closes on outside click

---

## Access Section

This is the core of the product. One copyable SSH hostname that works everywhere.

```
ACCESS

>_ SSH Host
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ distiller-8x29          [📋]│
└──────────────────────────────┘
Use this host in any IDE with SSH remote
support — VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains,
or plain ssh distiller-8x29
```

The app manages `~/.ssh/config` behind the scenes:

```
# ── Distiller (managed) ──────────────
Host distiller-8x29
    HostName 192.168.1.42
    User distiller
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/distiller_ed25519
# ── End Distiller ────────────────────
```

This means `ssh distiller-8x29` just works. VS Code Remote SSH picks it up. Cursor picks it up. JetBrains Gateway picks it up. No URI schemes, no IDE detection, no special buttons. One host, paste it anywhere.

<Callout type="info">
  **Why not IDE-specific buttons?** Because the actual technology is just SSH. The app writes an SSH config entry, and every tool that supports SSH remotes reads from `~/.ssh/config`. Adding "Open in VS Code" buttons would mean detecting installed IDEs, maintaining URI schemes, and breaking the moment a new IDE ships. The SSH host approach works with every tool, forever.

## Services Section

Auto-discovered services running on the device, forwarded to localhost.

```
SERVICES

🟢 Web Dev (3000)          📋 ↗
   http://localhost:3000

🟢 API Server (8080)       📋 ↗
   http://localhost:8080

🟢 PostgreSQL (5432)       📋
   localhost:5432
```

Each row shows:
- **Status dot** — green (tunnel active), yellow (connecting), red (service stopped on device)
- **Friendly name** — auto-labeled from well-known ports (see [Tunnels](/docs/desktop-app/tunnels#well-known-port-labels))
- **Port number** in parentheses
- **Local address** — what to use on the user's machine
- **📋 Copy** — copies local address to clipboard
- **↗ Open** — HTTP services only, opens in default browser. Not shown for databases.

### Empty State

When no services are detected:

```
SERVICES

No active services detected.

Start a server on your Distiller and
it will appear here automatically.
```

### Auto-Detection Behavior

The app queries the device for listening ports over the SSH connection.

- **On connect**: Full port scan, all services appear immediately
- **Polling**: Every 5 seconds, check for new/stopped services
- **New service**: Tunnel created automatically, appears in list
- **Service stopped**: Dot turns red, stays for 30s (in case it restarts), then fades out
- **Unknown ports**: Labeled "Port XXXX" — user can rename (persists across sessions)

---

## Custom Tunnel

```
+ Add port forward
```

Collapsed by default. Escape hatch for when auto-detection misses a port or the user needs a specific local port mapping. Clicking expands to a small form:

- Name (optional)
- Local port → Remote port
- "Add" button

Most users will never need this. Auto-detection handles the common cases.

## Connection States

The tray panel adapts its header based on connection state:

| State | Header shows | Panel content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Connected** | `● Connected · 22ms · 3 tunnels` | Normal panel — access + services |
| **Connecting** | `● Connecting to Distiller-8X29...` | Dimmed panel, progress in header |
| **Connection lost** | `● Connection lost · Reconnecting (3)...` | Last-known services shown dimmed |
| **Device offline** | `● Offline · Last seen 2h ago` | Recovery option if BLE available |
| **No devices** | `No devices paired` | Empty state with "Add Device" CTA |

---

## What to Build — Order

1. **Header** with device name, status dot, status line, gear icon
2. **Access section** with SSH host in a copyable code block
3. **Services section** with mock service list (static data first)
4. **Custom tunnel** collapsed link
5. **Device dropdown** with switching and "Add Device"
6. **Connection states** (start with "connected" only, add others as needed)
7. **Auto-detection** (polling, service lifecycle) — requires device connection, build last
