<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  **We don't build the UI. We build the pipe. You bring your own UI.** The desktop app is not an IDE, not a chat client, not a dashboard. It's the plumbing that makes your Distiller device accessible to whatever tools you already use.
</Callout>

## What This App Is

A tray-resident tunnel manager built with **Rust + Tauri v2**. It establishes SSH connections to your Distiller devices and forwards ports so that services running on the device appear at `localhost` on your machine.

The app's job is three things:

1. **Establish and maintain the SSH connection** to the Distiller
2. **Auto-discover and forward ports** so device services appear at localhost
3. **Give you a copyable SSH host** to plug into whatever tool you want

## Design & Deep Dives

Detailed design docs, protocol specs, and things still being worked out live in [Desktop WIP](/docs/desktop-wip). As decisions get locked, they move here.
