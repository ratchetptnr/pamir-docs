<Callout title="Core Philosophy">
  "Humans will not want to babysit AI." Pamir is built for a future where you delegate to agents, not supervise them. Where agents work autonomously and only interrupt when they genuinely need you.
</Callout>

## The Computer for Agents

Computing was designed for humans. Screens, keyboards, mice—every interface assumes a person is sitting there, watching, clicking, waiting.

**But the future of work isn't humans using computers. It's humans directing agents, and agents using computers.**

Pamir is the computer agents use.

## The Problem We're Solving

AI agents are capable of real work—coding, analysis, research, system administration. People are already trusting them with meaningful tasks.

But agents have nowhere to work.

They live in:
- **Chat windows** that disappear when you close the tab
- **IDEs** that require your laptop to stay open
- **Cloud functions** with no memory, no context, no continuity

**Agents are homeless.** They're capable of doing work but have no persistent place to do it.

## What Pamir Is

**Pamir is the office where your agents work.**

Not a tool you use. Not software you run. An *environment* where autonomous agents live, work, and only interrupt you when they genuinely need something.

### The Core Idea

You have agents. They have tasks. Pamir gives them a place to execute those tasks independently while you go live your life.

- **Persistent**: Your agent's workspace doesn't disappear when you close your laptop
- **Always-on**: Agents can work overnight, over weekends, across days
- **Sovereign**: It's yours. Your agents, your data, your control
- **Physical**: Agents can interact with the real world through hardware
- **Notification-driven**: Agents reach out when they need you, not the other way around

**It's the difference between having a contractor work in your living room versus having an office where your team works while you're elsewhere.**

## The Shift

### Era 1: Humans work, computers assist
Spreadsheets, word processors, development tools. The computer amplifies human capability. Human always in control, always present.

### Era 2: Agents work, humans supervise ← *We are here*
AI writes code, generates content, analyzes data. Human provides direction and intervention. Still requires constant human presence.

### Era 3: Agents work, humans delegate ← *Pamir is built for this*
Agents handle entire workflows autonomously. Humans provide goals and constraints. Human presence is intermittent, as-needed.

**Most tools are built for Era 1. Some are adapting to Era 2. Pamir is designed from first principles for Era 3.**

## The Mobile-First Insight

In the agent future, your primary device is your phone, not your laptop.

Why? Because if agents are doing the computational work, you don't need a keyboard and screen anymore. You need:
- A way to **delegate** tasks (voice, text, quick inputs)
- A way to **check status** (notifications, dashboards)
- A way to **approve decisions** (simple touch interfaces)
- A way to **review work** (mobile-friendly outputs)

**Pamir is the backend infrastructure that makes mobile-first agent delegation possible.**

Your laptop is where you used to *do* work. Your phone is where you *manage* work. **Pamir is where work gets done.**

## The Experience

**Morning:** "Hey, I need a report on Q4 performance by EOD."

*Phone buzzes: "Task received. Starting analysis."*

**Midday:** *Notification: "Found inconsistency in sales data. Should I use preliminary or revised figures?"*

"Use revised." *"Got it. Continuing."*

**Evening:** *"Q4 report complete. 24 pages, 8 charts. Ready to review."*

### What Just Happened

The agent worked for 6+ hours autonomously. Accessed multiple data sources. Made independent decisions. Only interrupted twice for genuine judgment calls.

The human spent 10 minutes total. Never opened a laptop. Stayed in flow on other priorities. Maintained control without micromanagement.

**This is the boss-employee model, applied to AI.**

## About This Documentation

This documentation is for the Pamir/Distiller development team. It explains the **"why"** behind our architectural decisions and the **user experience philosophy** that drives the product.

### What's Documented

- **Onboarding** - Device setup flow designed for zero-friction agent activation
- **WiFi** - Self-healing connectivity with BLE-based recovery
- **Bluetooth** - Dual-mode architecture serving system recovery and peripherals
- **Display** - E-ink settings optimized for agent status, not human interaction
- **Audio** - Voice input/output for agent communication
- **LED Indicators** - Ambient status communication when screens aren't watched
- **System** - Device identity and health monitoring
- **Security** - Trust boundaries for autonomous agent operations
- **Notifications** - Intelligent interruption protocols for delegation, not babysitting

These aren't just features. They're the primitives that make agent autonomy possible.

## The Vision

**Pamir is the persistent, sovereign, always-on workspace where your AI agents live, work, and only interrupt you when they need something you haven't already told them how to handle.**

Because the future of work isn't humans using computers.

It's humans directing agents, and agents using computers.

**Pamir is the computer agents use.**
