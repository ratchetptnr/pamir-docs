title: Settings Framework
description: The philosophy for distinguishing User Preferences (Settings) from App Capabilities (SDK).

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  **"The User Owns the Default State."**
  A generic toggle is not a setting. Only clear user preferences that define the "resting state" or "identity" of the device belong in Settings. Capability tuning belongs to the App/SDK logic that uses it.
</Callout>

## The Challenge

As the OS capabilities grow, the list of potential knobs and dials explodes. Providing every possible hardware configuration option to the user creates a cluttered, confusing "Airplane Cockpit" interface.

We need a razor to decide: **Does this belong in the System Settings app?**

---

## The Core Distinction

We divide all configuration into two worlds:

### 1. User Settings (System)
*The Global Reference.*
This is the user telling the device who they are and how they generally like things. These settings apply **globally** and persist across reboots as the "default state".

*   **Identity**: "My name is Distiller-01."
*   **Preference**: "I prefer Dark Mode."
*   **Constraint**: "Never go louder than 80% volume." (Safety/Comfort)
*   **Connectivity**: "Connect to Home Wi-Fi."

### 2. SDK Capabilities (App/Agent)
*The Momentary Tool.*
This is an application or agent taking control to perform a specific task. These are **momentary** states determined by code, not user preference.

*   **Task Requirement**: "Record at 16kHz for Whisper." (Not a user preference for 'Low Quality audio')
*   **Context**: "Blink Red because *this specific error* happened."
*   **Mode**: "Use high-contrast display for *this reading app*."

## The Filter Analysis

We applied this filter to our hardware capabilities to decide what surfaces to the user.

### Audio & Voice
| Item | Decision | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Master Volume** | ✅ **Setting** | Global output limit/preference. |
| **Sample Rate** | ❌ **SDK** | Users don't "prefer" 44.1kHz. Apps *require* it. |
| **Microphone Gain** | ✅ **Setting** | Hardware calibration. "My room is quiet/loud". |

### Display (E-ink)
| Item | Decision | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Orientation** | ✅ **Setting** | Physical constraint. "I hold it upside down". |
| **Refresh Mode** | ❌ **SDK** | Reading apps need "Quality"; Terminal apps need "Speed". App decides. |
| **Dithering** | ❌ **SDK** | Technical rendering choice. |

### Camera (Legacy)
| Item | Decision | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Global Privacy** | ✅ **Setting** | "Block camera access physically/software-wise." |
| **Brightness** | ❌ **SDK** | Auto-exposure should handle this. Manual override is for a "Camera App", not System Settings. |

### LED Indicators
| Item | Decision | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stealth Mode** | ✅ **Setting** | "I am sleeping. No lights." (User preference trumps system feedback). |
| **Idle Color** | ✅ **Setting** | "What color is 'resting'?" |
| **Animations** | ❌ **SDK** | Apps trigger Specific animations (Rainbow, Blink) for signals. |

## The Resulting Surface

By stripping away the SDK capabilities, we reveal a clean, focused Settings structure for the iOS App.

### 🌐 Connectivity
*   **Wi-Fi / Bluetooth**: The lifeline.
*   **Updates**: Keeping the brain fresh.

### ⚙️ General
*   **Identity**: Device Name.
*   **Storage**: Capacity and Cache clearing (Maintenance).
*   **Language**: System-wide language preference.

### 💡 Hardware Preference
*   **Stealth Mode**: The "Do Not Disturb" for hardware LEDs.
*   **Idle Color**: Personalization.
*   **Camera Privacy**: The legacy kill-switch.
*   **Orientation**: Physical setup.

### 🔊 Senses
*   **Volume & Gain**: Input/Output calibration.
*   **System Voice**: Who speaks to me? (TTS Voice).
