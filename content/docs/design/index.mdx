<Callout title="Developer Reference">
  This section documents **why** things work the way they do. It's intended for developers who need to understand the system architecture, make implementation decisions, or debug complex issues.
</Callout>

The Pamir system follows consistent design principles across all components. This documentation explains the reasoning behind architectural choices and provides implementation guidance.

## Design Philosophy

All design decisions at Pamir derive from three fundamental truths defined in [First Principles](/docs/design/first-principles):

1. **The Agent Works. The Human Directs.** — The app is a command center, not a workbench.
2. **The Device Exists Without You.** — The relationship is asynchronous. Design for the returning user.
3. **Trust Is the Product.** — Every pixel either builds trust or erodes it.

Every feature must pass the **Five Filters** (Director, Reentry, Trust, Craft, Necessity) before it ships. See the full framework for details.

## When to Reference This Section

- **Implementing new features**: Understand existing patterns before adding code
- **Debugging connectivity issues**: The state machine docs explain expected behavior
- **Making architectural decisions**: See rationale for previous choices
- **Onboarding new developers**: Learn why, not just what
