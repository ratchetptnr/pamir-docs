<Callout title="Developer Reference">
  This section documents **why** things work the way they do. It's intended for developers who need to understand the system architecture, make implementation decisions, or debug complex issues.
</Callout>

The Pamir system follows consistent design principles across all components. This documentation explains the reasoning behind architectural choices and provides implementation guidance.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. User-Focused Architecture

Technical decisions should improve user experience. Complex state machines exist to provide clear, consistent feedback—not to satisfy engineering elegance.

### 2. Explicit Over Implicit

State transitions, error handling, and user messaging should be explicit and documented. Hidden behaviors create debugging nightmares.

### 3. Graceful Degradation

When systems fail (and they will), users should understand what happened and have clear paths forward. Offline doesn't mean broken.

### 4. Platform Conventions

Follow iOS and web platform conventions. Users shouldn't need to learn new interaction patterns for familiar concepts.

## When to Reference This Section

- **Implementing new features**: Understand existing patterns before adding code
- **Debugging connectivity issues**: The state machine docs explain expected behavior
- **Making architectural decisions**: See rationale for previous choices
- **Onboarding new developers**: Learn why, not just what
