<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
The Workspace is a window manager, not a file manager. It shows what you're working on **right now**. Closing a window doesn't mean destroying its contents — the system handles persistence intelligently behind the scenes.
</Callout>

The Workspace is your primary work environment within a project. It displays all open windows and provides quick access to **Chat History**.

## Overview

The Workspace follows a clean, native iOS list design that shows all active windows for the current project. Each window represents a Chat, Terminal, or Editor instance. Windows are sorted by most recent activity.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/workspace-main.png"
    alt="Workspace main view with open windows"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
Each project maintains its own set of windows, so switching projects shows that project's workspace.
</Callout>

The toolbar header shows the **project name**. When the user has multiple devices, the **device name** appears below it — giving context about which device you're working on. With a single device, the device name is omitted since it's redundant.

## Window Types

The Workspace supports three types of windows, each with a distinct icon and color:

- [**Chat**](./chat) (Blue) — Conversational AI interface. **Persistent** — closing archives the session for later.
- [**Terminal**](./terminal) (Gray) — Command-line interface. **Ephemeral** — closing ends the session.
- [**Editor**](./editor) (Orange) — Code viewer/editor. **Ephemeral** — closing ends the session; files remain on device.

## Creating Windows

Tap the **+** button in the top-right corner to create a new window:

1. Tap the **+** button
2. Select **Chat**, **Terminal**, or **Editor** from the menu
3. The new window appears in the list and opens immediately

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/workspace-new-window.png"
    alt="Creating a new window"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Closing Windows

Swipe left on any window to close it. No confirmation dialog — you're just closing a window.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/workspace-swipe-close.png"
    alt="Swipe to close a window"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

The gesture is the same for all three types. What happens behind the scenes differs:

| Type | What "close" does | Why |
|------|------------------|-----|
| **Chat** | Archived — preserved and restorable from History | Chat sessions hold valuable context for future work |
| **Terminal** | Removed — session ends | Ephemeral by nature, like closing a terminal window |
| **Editor** | Removed — session ends | Ephemeral session; the file still lives on the device |

<Callout title="The Window Manager Mental Model">
Think of it like a desktop OS. Closing a Finder window doesn't delete your files. Closing a Terminal window ends that session. The Workspace works the same way — it manages what's currently open, and the system preserves what matters.
</Callout>

## Chat History

Closed chats don't disappear — they move to **Chat History**. This is accessible via the clock icon in the toolbar (only visible when archived chats exist).

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/workspace-history-button.png"
    alt="History button in workspace toolbar"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

History groups archived chats by time:
- **Recent** — archived in the last 24 hours
- **This Week** — archived 1–7 days ago
- **Earlier** — everything older

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/workspace-history-sheet.png"
    alt="Chat History sheet with archived chats"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

To restore a chat, tap it or swipe right. The chat returns to the active workspace with its full message history intact.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/workspace-history-restore.png"
    alt="Swipe to restore an archived chat"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Window Metadata

Each window in the list shows:
- **Type icon** with color coding
- **Title** — auto-generated from the first message (for chats) or the window type
- **Preview** — last message snippet or default text
- **Timestamp** — time if today, date otherwise
- **Unread indicator** — blue dot when the AI has responded since you last viewed

## Empty State

When a project has no open windows, the Workspace shows a prompt to get started.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/workspace-empty.png"
    alt="Workspace empty state"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>
