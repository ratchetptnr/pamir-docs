The Workspace is your primary work environment within a project. It displays all open tabs and provides quick access to Intelligence briefings.

## Overview

The Workspace follows a clean, native iOS list design that shows all active tabs for the current project. Each tab represents a Chat, Terminal, or Editor instance with its own persistent state.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/workspace-main.png" 
    alt="Workspace main view with open tabs" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
Each project maintains its own set of tabs, so switching projects will show that project's workspace.
</Callout>

## Tab Types

The Workspace supports three types of tabs, each with a distinct icon and color:

- **Chat** (Blue) - Conversational AI interface for natural language interaction
- **Terminal** (Black) - Command-line interface for direct system access
- **Editor** (Purple) - Code editor for viewing and editing project files

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/workspace-tab-types.png" 
    alt="Different tab types in the workspace" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Creating Tabs

Tap the **+** button in the top-right corner to create a new tab. You can choose which type of tab to create:

1. Tap the **+** button
2. Select **Chat**, **Terminal**, or **Editor** from the menu
3. The new tab appears in the list and becomes active

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/workspace-new-tab.png" 
    alt="Creating a new tab" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Managing Tabs

### Opening a Tab
Tap any tab in the list to open it. The view transitions to show the tab's content.

### Closing Tabs
Swipe left on any tab to reveal the **Close** action. This removes the tab and its state from the workspace.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/workspace-swipe-delete.png" 
    alt="Swipe to close a tab" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

<Callout type="warn">
Closing a Chat tab will permanently remove its message history from your device.
</Callout>

## Intelligence Access

The **newspaper icon** in the top-right toolbar provides quick access to the Intelligence page, where you can view:

- **Timeline**: Chronological history of completed work
- **Briefings**: AI-generated insights and suggestions

See [Intelligence Page](./intelligence) for more details.

## Empty State

When a project has no open tabs, the Workspace displays a helpful empty state prompting you to create your first tab.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/workspace-empty.png" 
    alt="Workspace empty state" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>
