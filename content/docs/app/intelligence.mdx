The Intelligence Page is your AI-powered project briefing room. It aggregates completed work into a timeline and surfaces proactive insights in the Briefings tab.

## Overview

The Intelligence Page consists of two main sections accessed via tabs:

- **Timeline**: A chronological feed of recent work, sorted newest to oldest
- **Briefings**: AI-generated opportunities and suggestions for improvements

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/intelligence-timeline.png" 
    alt="Intelligence Timeline view" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
The Shadow Agent continuously monitors your work and updates these feeds in real-time.
</Callout>

## Timeline Tab

The Timeline shows a reverse-chronological list of completed activities. Each item displays:

- **Primary text**: What was completed (e.g., "Fixed Navigation Bug")
- **Timestamp**: When the work was completed (e.g., "2 mins ago")
- **Icon**: Visual indicator of the activity type

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/intelligence-timeline-items.png" 
    alt="Timeline items with timestamps" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Timeline Item Details

Tapping any timeline item opens a detail sheet showing:

- Full description of the completed work
- Context (which chat or investigation it came from)
- Action buttons to continue the conversation

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/intelligence-timeline-detail.png" 
    alt="Timeline item detail sheet" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Briefings Tab

The Briefings tab surfaces AI-generated insights, such as:

- Code quality opportunities
- Potential bugs or edge cases
- Architecture suggestions
- Performance optimizations

Unlike Timeline items, Briefings do not show timestamps—they represent ongoing opportunities rather than historical events.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/intelligence-briefings.png" 
    alt="Briefings tab view" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Briefing Detail Sheet

Tapping a briefing opens a detail sheet with:

- Full explanation of the suggested improvement
- Context about why this matters
- Action options to address the suggestion

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/intelligence-briefing-detail.png" 
    alt="Briefing detail sheet" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Taking Action

Both Timeline and Briefing detail sheets offer two primary actions:

### Open in Chat
Creates a new Chat tab pre-populated with the context from the selected item. This allows you to:

- Ask follow-up questions
- Request modifications
- Explore related code

### Start Investigation
Triggers the AI agent to perform a deeper analysis of the item. This opens [The Desk](./desk) where you can monitor the investigation in real-time.

<Callout type="tip">
Use "Open in Chat" for conversational exploration. Use "Start Investigation" when you want the agent to autonomously analyze and report findings.
</Callout>

## Empty States

When there's no data to display, the Intelligence Page shows helpful empty states:

- **Timeline**: "No activity yet. Open a tab to get started."
- **Briefings**: "All clear. Shadow Agent will notify you of opportunities."

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img

    alt="Intelligence empty state" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>
