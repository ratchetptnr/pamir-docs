import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

The Chat interface provides a natural language conversation experience with the AI agent. It supports rich markdown formatting, code syntax highlighting, and persistent message history.

## Overview

Chat tabs are the primary way to interact with the Shadow Agent. Each chat maintains its own conversation history, which persists across app restarts.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/chat-main.png" 
    alt="Chat interface with conversation" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
Each Chat tab has a unique persistent history. Opening the same tab later will restore all previous messages.
</Callout>

## Message Interface

### User Messages
Your messages appear in blue bubbles aligned to the right, following the familiar iMessage design pattern.

### AI Responses
The agent's responses appear as left-aligned text with full markdown rendering, including:

- **Headings** for structure
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- `Inline code` snippets
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Lists (ordered and unordered)

## Quick Actions

The **+** icon next to the message input unlocks powerful shortcuts for inspecting your environment and preparing context.

### 1. Unified Quick Menu
Tap the **+** button to reveal the Quick Actions menu. This central hub allows you to quickly pivot between different diagnostic and context-building tools without leaving the chat.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/chat-quick-actions-menu.png" 
    alt="Quick Actions menu showing Terminal and Attach File options" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### 2. Integrated Terminal
Access a full-featured terminal directly from the chat. This is ideal for quickly running commands, checking system status, or listing directories while maintaining your conversation context.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/chat-terminal-view.png" 
    alt="Terminal sheet presented over the chat interface" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### 3. File Attachments
Need to discuss specific code? Tap **Attach File** to browse your project structure and link relevant files to the chat. The AI agent will use the content of these files to provide more precise and contextual assistance.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/chat-file-picker.png" 
    alt="File picker interface for selecting project documents" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

<Callout type="tip">
When you attach a file, a visual tag `[Attached: filename]` is added to your input as confirmation.
</Callout>

## Empty State

When a chat has no messages, it displays a centered prompt encouraging you to start a conversation:

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/chat-empty.png" 
    alt="Empty chat state" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Message Persistence

Chat history is automatically saved to disk on a per-tab basis. This means:

- Closing the app preserves your conversations
- Each Chat tab maintains its own independent history
- Deleting a tab removes its message history

<Callout type="warn">
Message history is stored locally on your device and syncs with the paired Distiller hardware.
</Callout>

## Notes Integration

While chatting with the Shadow Agent, you can access your project's notes directly from the **top-right toolbar**. This allows you to:

- **Reference Insights**: Look up previous decisions or code snippets without leaving the chat.
- **Capture Ideas**: Quickly jot down a new note based on the agent's response.
- **Cross-Link**: The AI can refer to specific notes during a conversation to provide deeper context.
