import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

The Chat interface provides a natural language conversation experience with the AI agent. It supports rich markdown formatting, code syntax highlighting, and persistent message history.

## Overview

Chat tabs are the primary way to interact with the Shadow Agent. Each chat maintains its own conversation history, which persists across app restarts.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/chat-main.png" 
    alt="Chat interface with conversation" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
Each Chat tab has a unique persistent history. Opening the same tab later will restore all previous messages.
</Callout>

## Message Interface

### User Messages
Your messages appear in blue bubbles aligned to the right, following the familiar iMessage design pattern.

### AI Responses
The agent's responses appear as left-aligned text with full markdown rendering, including:

- **Headings** for structure
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- `Inline code` snippets
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Lists (ordered and unordered)

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/chat-markdown.png" 
    alt="Markdown rendering in chat" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>


## Empty State

When a chat has no messages, it displays a centered prompt encouraging you to start a conversation:

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/chat-empty.png" 
    alt="Empty chat state" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Message Persistence

Chat history is automatically saved to disk on a per-tab basis. This means:

- Closing the app preserves your conversations
- Each Chat tab maintains its own independent history
- Deleting a tab removes its message history

<Callout type="warn">
Message history is stored locally on your device and syncs with the paired Distiller hardware.
</Callout>
