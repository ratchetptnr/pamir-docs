## What is a Provider?

Distiller is an AI hardware device. To power AI features like Chat, it needs an **AI provider** — think of it as the brain. The user brings their own subscription to a provider, and Distiller connects to it.

Distiller is **provider-agnostic**. The architecture supports any AI provider. Currently supported:

- **Claude Code** (Anthropic) — first supported provider
- **OpenAI** — planned

The model is "bring your own subscription." The user authenticates with their existing provider account, and Distiller uses their credentials to access the AI service.

<Callout type="info">
  Terminal, Editor, and file management all work without a provider. **Chat is the feature that requires an active provider connection.**
</Callout>

## Providers vs Services

Distiller has two distinct concepts that are often confused:

| | Providers | Services / Apps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **What** | AI brains — external AI services | Software that runs on the device |
| **Examples** | Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI | Clawdbot, VSCode, Happy Client |
| **Setup** | OAuth to the provider's website | Enable/configure in the app |
| **Subscription** | User's own (bring your own) | None — runs locally on device |
| **Dependency** | Distiller connects to provider's API | Services may use a provider, or run independently |

**Services can be anything** — an AI-powered app like Clawdbot, a code editor like VSCode, a stock exchange monitor, or any tool a user wants to run on their device. Some services may depend on a provider (e.g. an AI chat app needs an AI brain), others run independently (e.g. a monitoring tool). Services are a broad concept and will have their own documentation — this page focuses on providers only.

## Setup During Onboarding

After WiFi is connected (or confirmed from migration), the app presents the provider setup screen. This is Phase 4 of [Onboarding](/docs/app/onboarding-v3).

### Authorization Sequence

This is how the app, provider, and device communicate during setup. The flow is the same regardless of which provider is being connected — only the authorization page changes.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Provider Setup** | "Connect an AI provider to power Chat on your Distiller." List of available providers. | Select a provider (primary), "I'll do this later" (text link) |
| **Authorization** | In-app browser at the provider's authorization page | User authenticates externally with their provider account |
| **Connecting** | Spinner + "Setting up [Provider Name]..." | Auto-advances on success. Shows error with retry on failure. |
| **Ready** | Success state + connected account info | "Continue" proceeds to Setup Complete |

## "No Provider" UX

When a user skips provider setup during onboarding (or hasn't set one up yet), the app needs to make setup accessible without being annoying.

**Design principle: helpful when relevant, invisible otherwise.**

### Contextual — Input field as trigger

The chat empty state is always the same whether the user has a provider or not. No special "connect provider" empty state. The input field also looks identical — same placeholder, same buttons, full opacity. The difference is what happens when the user interacts:

- **Provider connected:** Input field activates normally — keyboard appears, user types.
- **No provider:** Tapping anywhere on the input field (text area, buttons) presents a sheet to connect an AI provider. The tap is caught before the keyboard opens — the user never gets to type.

Starter suggestion chips also appear regardless of provider status. Tapping a suggestion without a provider shows the same provider setup sheet.

The sheet is lightweight — just a prompt to connect a provider with a list of available options. Dismissing returns the user to the chat. No alerts, no blocking, no extra empty state code.

### Always Available

Zero-pressure, user-initiated.

- **Settings > AI Provider** — full configuration page, always accessible
- **Red badge dot** — appears in two places when no provider is configured:
  - On the **AI Provider** row inside Settings
  - On the **gear icon** in the project list toolbar (same dot used for device-offline indicator)

### What We Don't Do

- No special empty state for "no provider" — chat empty state is always the same
- No disabled or dimmed input field — it looks identical with or without a provider
- No modals or alerts blocking input
- No modals on app launch
- No blocking the workspace or project list
- No recurring notifications or reminders
- No countdown timers or urgency language
- No "you're missing out" messaging
- No nudges in Terminal or Editor — they work without a provider

| `skipped` | User deferred | Tapped "I'll do this later" during onboarding | Tapping chat input shows provider sheet. Settings badge visible. |
| `connected` | Provider linked | Completed OAuth (onboarding, Settings, or chat input sheet) | Full Chat functionality. No nudges. Account info in Settings. |

## Terminal Setup Path

Providers don't have to be configured through the setup wizard. If a user configures a provider via **terminal commands** — for example, by setting API keys directly on the device — the app should detect this and reflect the connected state.

- The app periodically checks the device's provider configuration
- If a provider is detected that wasn't set up through the wizard, the app transitions to the `connected` state
- The user sees the same UX as if they used the setup wizard — no difference
- This is a **valid and supported setup path**, not a workaround

This matters because power users and developers may prefer terminal-based configuration, and the app should respect that.

## Settings > AI Provider

Located at **Settings > AI Provider**. This is the always-accessible entry point — never pushy.

Single section layout (iOS Wi-Fi settings style) with a hero tile at the top showing the provider logo, name, and description.

### When Not Configured (`none` / `skipped`)

- Hero tile with provider logo + description
- **"Connect"** button — triggers the same OAuth flow as onboarding

### When Connected

- Hero tile (same as above)
- **Account** row showing connected email
- **Default Model** picker (e.g. Haiku, Sonnet, Opus for Claude)
- **"Disconnect Account"** action
  - Confirmation: "Disconnect Claude? Chat will be unavailable until you connect a provider."
  - Confirm → state returns to `none`, badge dots reappear

### Items Under Consideration

<Callout>
  The following are listed for awareness. **No design decisions have been made** on these yet.
</Callout>

- **Usage display** — showing token usage or costs. Likely useful, design TBD.
- **Subscription status** — showing active/expired/payment status from the provider. No decision taken.
- **Multi-device** — managing one provider subscription across multiple Distillers. No decision taken.

## Authorization Flow

<Callout type="warn" title="WIP">
  OAuth integration is not yet implemented. The demo app uses a mock authorization view. This section outlines the intended approach. The **user experience** below is what we're committing to — the under-the-hood mechanics are our best understanding and are open to engineer feedback. If a different mechanism achieves the same or better UX, we're open to it.
</Callout>

### What the User Experiences

The authorization flow follows the standard "bring your own subscription" pattern — the same experience as connecting a service on a PC or web app:

1. User taps "Connect" and selects a provider
2. A browser opens to the provider's authorization page
3. User signs in with their existing provider account and authorizes Distiller
4. Browser closes, app shows the provider is ready

| Step | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auth method** | `ASWebAuthenticationSession` (iOS native in-app browser) |
| **Redirect** | App opens the provider's authorization page (URL is provider-specific, configured per provider) |
| **User action** | User signs in and authorizes Distiller on the provider's website |

### Under the Hood

<Callout type="info" title="Open to feedback">
  This is our current understanding of how the authorization works mechanically. Engineers — if you see a better approach that delivers the same user experience, let us know.
</Callout>

The provider's CLI (e.g. Claude Code) is already installed on the device. The app acts as an intermediary to make the login seamless:

1. **App sends a login command** to the device terminal (e.g. `/login` for Claude Code)
2. **Provider CLI generates an authorization URL** — it outputs a link the user needs to visit
3. **Device sends the URL back to the app** — the app detects or receives this URL
4. **App opens the URL** in an in-app browser (`ASWebAuthenticationSession`)
5. **User authenticates** on the provider's website
6. **Auth completes** — credentials are stored on the device by the provider's CLI itself
7. **App detects the provider is now connected** and updates its state accordingly

### Entry Points

The OAuth flow is identical regardless of where it's triggered:

<Mermaid chart={`

    Onboarding[Onboarding\nPhase 4] --> OAuth[Same OAuth Flow]

    Result -->|Failed| Error[Show error\n+ retry]

    style OAuth fill:#4a9eff,color:#fff
    style Connected fill:#e1f5e1
`} />

## Error Handling

| Error | Where | What user sees | Recovery |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authorization cancelled** | Onboarding or Settings | Nothing — returns to setup screen | Tap "Connect" again |
| **Network failure** | Onboarding or Settings | "Couldn't connect. Check your internet and try again." | Retry or Skip |
| **Auth rejected** | Onboarding or Settings | "Authorization failed. Please try again." | Retry or Skip |
| **Device configuration failed** | After authorization | "Couldn't configure provider on your device." | Retry or Skip |
| **Disconnect failed** | Settings | "Couldn't disconnect. Please try again." | Retry |

All errors provide a clear path forward. Skip is always available during onboarding. From Settings, the user can dismiss and try again later.

## WIP / Future

<Callout type="warn" title="Not Yet Designed">
  The following items are on the radar but not yet spec'd. Items marked "no decision taken" are listed for awareness only — they may or may not become features.
</Callout>

**Likely:**
- **OpenAI provider support** — second provider, same setup flow pattern
- **Additional providers** — architecture is open, any provider can be added
- **Model selection per provider** — letting user pick default model. Design TBD.
- **Usage tracking** — token counts, cost display. Likely useful, design TBD.

**No decision taken:**
- Subscription status sync with provider
- Multi-device provider management (one sub across multiple Distillers)

**Separate documentation:**
- Services (Clawdbot, VSCode, Happy Client, etc.) — will have their own setup docs
- Service ↔ provider relationships (which services use which providers)
