The Editor tab is your window into the project's codebase. It allows you to navigate the file structure, view code with syntax highlighting, and make edits to project files.

## Overview

The Editor is designed to be a clean, read-focused environment that steps out of your way. It provides a familiar, **IDE-like experience** complete with line numbers, monospaced fonts, and rich syntax highlighting, ensuring you can review code comfortably just as you would on a desktop.

## Opening a File

Navigating your project structure is simple. Follow these steps to locate and open any file in your repository.

### 1. View the Empty State
When you first open a new Editor tab, you are greeted with a clean empty state. Tap the **Folder Icon** in the top-right toolbar (or the "Open Project" button) to get started.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/editor-empty.png" 
    alt="Editor empty state prompting to open a file" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### 2. Browse the File Tree
The **Project Explorer** sheet appears, displaying your project's complete file hierarchy. You can expand folders and scroll through the list to find the file you need.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/editor-finder-tree.png" 
    alt="Project explorer showing the file tree" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### 3. View Code
Tapping a file instantly opens it in the main editor view. The interface adapts to provide an IDE-quality reading experience specific to the file usage.

</Callout>

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/editor-code-view.png" 
    alt="Editor displaying code with IDE-like syntax highlighting" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting
The editor automatically detects the file type based on its extension and applies appropriate syntax highlighting, just like a standard IDE. Whether you're working with Swift, Python, Markdown, or JSON, the interface provides the visual context you expect from a professional development environment.

### Notes Integration
The **Notes** icon is always available in the **top-right toolbar**. This split-context view allows you to:
- Read code while taking documentation notes
- Reference architectural plans while reviewing implementation
- Copy code snippets directly into your notes for safekeeping
- Access the project's full shared context
