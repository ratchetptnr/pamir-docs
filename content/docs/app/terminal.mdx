The Terminal tab provides a familiar command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the underlying system. It mimics a standard shell environment, allowing you to execute commands and view output directly within the app.

## Overview

The Terminal offers a distraction-free environment for users who prefer text-based interaction. It maintains a history of your session, listing executed commands and their corresponding outputs in a chronological view.





## Features

### Shell Commands
The terminal provides access to a standard shell environment. You can use typical Unix-like commands to navigate the file system, inspect files, and manage your project environment as you would in any professional CLI.

### Command History
Every command you execute is logged in the session history. You can scroll back up to review previous outputs, making it easy to track your work.

## Interface

- **Input Line**: The bottom of the screen features a fixed input bar with the `user@pamir %` prompt.
- **Scrollable Output**: The main area displays the conversation history with the shell.
- **Top Toolbar**: Includes a quick access button to the **Notes** sheet.

## Notes Integration

Just like other tabs, the Terminal provides direct access to your project's Universal Notes via the **top-right toolbar**. This is particularly useful for:
- Logging command outputs
- Saving complex command strings for later use
- Referencing technical documentation while working in the shell
