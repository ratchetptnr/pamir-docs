<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  Notes are context fuel for the AI. They provide a shared long-term memory that allows the Shadow Agent to learn your intent and perform better within the project's specific domain.
</Callout>

## Context as a Service

The primary goal of Notes is to provide the AI with the high-quality context it needs to do its job effectively. By capturing project-specific nuances, Notes bridge the gap between generic AI capabilities and your unique requirements.

- **AI Learning**: The Shadow Agent actively collects context from your workflow to learn the project's architecture and decisions.
- **User Agency**: You can leave explicit context (notes) to guide the AI, effectively "teaching" it what matters most.
- **Persistent Memory**: Unlike chat history which can be transient, Notes represent a durable source of truth that the AI refers back to for every task.

### Accessing Notes

Notes are accessible from the top-right toolbar across all major working environments. Tapping the **Notes** icon opens a floating native sheet, allowing you to reference or capture information without switching context:

- **Chat**: Reference key decisions or snippets during a conversation.
- **Terminal**: Log command sequences or error traces discovered during execution.
- **Editor**: Document the rationale behind specific code blocks.
- **Project Workspace**: Manage and search the entire collection from the project hub.

## Shadow Agent Collaboration

The knowledge base is co-authored by you and the Shadow Agent.

- **Automated Capture**: The Shadow Agent automatically summarizes key insights and decisions into project notes.
- **Real-time Notifications**: You are notified immediately whenever the Shadow Agent creates a new note, ensuring you stay in the loop.
- **Manual Control**: Users can create, edit, or organize notes at any time to refine the project's knowledge base.

## The Editing Experience

Tapping any note opens a refined, native iOS experience. We've intentionaly mirrored the **Apple Notes** paradigm to ensure the interface feels invisible and frictionless.

| Feature | Design Logic |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native List View** | Uses `.insetGrouped` styling to provide high contrast and familiarity. |
| **Searchable Header** | A standard iOS search pill is always present to find insights instantly. |
| **Date Grouping** | Notes are automatically categorized into buckets (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days) to provide chronological context. |
| **Clean Typography** | Bold headlines and subheadline previews ensure scannability. |

## Golden Rules of Notes

1. **Project Centric**: Notes never leak between projects. They are strictly scoped to the active workspace.
2. **Context is King**: Every note aims to link back to the specific tab, chat, or file where it originated.
3. **Editable by Default**: No note is "read-only." Whether generated by AI or a human, the user always has the final word.
