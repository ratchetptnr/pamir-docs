<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "Notes are the connective tissue of a project." Unlike traditional documentation that lives in a silo, Pamir Notes are ephemeral yet persistent, designed to be accessed the moment an insight occurs—whether you're debugging in the terminal or sketching an architecture in chat.
</Callout>

## The Universal Knowledge Base

Every project in Pamir maintains its own dedicated set of Notes. This ensures that context is never lost and that your "Shadow Agent" has a consistent source of truth to refer back to. Notes are not just a storage bin; they are the living memory of your project's evolution.

### Universal Entry Points

Notes are designed to be "always within reach." You don't leave your work to take a note; you bring the notes to your work via floating native sheets:

- **Inside Chat**: Capture a decision or a snippet without losing the flow of the conversation.
- **Inside Terminal**: Log a command sequence or a complex error trace for later reference.
- **Inside Editor**: Document an architectural "why" directly next to the code.
- **Project Workspace**: View, search, and organize the entire collection from the main project hub.

## Dual-Role Authoring

The knowledge base is built through a partnership between you and the **Shadow Agent**.

### 1. Collaborative Intelligence
The Shadow Agent automatically captures key insights, architectural decisions, and bug fixes as you work. It identifies "moments of importance" and drafts them into your project notes so you don't have to. 

### 2. User Agency
While the AI simplifies documentation, you remain in full control. You can:
- **Direct Authoring**: Create notes from scratch to document your intent.
- **Correction**: Edit AI-generated notes to refine accuracy or add missing nuance.
- **Organization**: Tag and group notes to match your mental model of the project.

## The Editing Experience

Tapping any note opens a refined, native iOS experience. We've intentionaly mirrored the **Apple Notes** paradigm to ensure the interface feels invisible and frictionless.

| Feature | Design Logic |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Native List View** | Uses `.insetGrouped` styling to provide high contrast and familiarity. |
| **Searchable Header** | A standard iOS search pill is always present to find insights instantly. |
| **Date Grouping** | Notes are automatically categorized into buckets (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days) to provide chronological context. |
| **Clean Typography** | Bold headlines and subheadline previews ensure scannability. |

## Golden Rules of Notes

1. **Project Centric**: Notes never leak between projects. They are strictly scoped to the active workspace.
2. **Context is King**: Every note aims to link back to the specific tab, chat, or file where it originated.
3. **Editable by Default**: No note is "read-only." Whether generated by AI or a human, the user always has the final word.
