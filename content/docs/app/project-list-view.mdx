The Project List View is the central hub for managing your development environments. It follows native iOS design patterns to provide a responsive and clear user experience.

## Overview

The Project List View displays all projects associated with your active device. It supports quick searching, project deletion via swipe actions, and various creation methods.

    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Device Management

Pamir allows you to manage multiple Distiller devices seamlessly from a single app instance.

### Switching Devices
You can switch between active devices using the device selector at the top of the project list. This instantly updates the list to show projects stored on the selected device.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">

    alt="Device switching menu" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Adding a New Device
To add a new Distiller, tap the "Add Device" option in the device menu. This triggers the [Onboarding Flow](./onboarding) to securely pair and configure your new hardware.

## Creating Projects

Pamir supports three primary ways to create projects, each optimized for speed and clarity.

### 1. Create Empty Project
Best for starting fresh. The app creates a managed directory on your device instantly.
- **UX Flow:** Instant feedback. The view navigates to the Project Overview immediately.

### 2. Open Local Folder
Allows you to bring existing code into the Pamir ecosystem.
- **UX Flow:** Uses the native Folder Picker. Navigation is instantaneous once a folder is selected.

### 3. Clone Git Repository
For projects hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or bitbucket.
- **UX Flow:** Unlike the other methods, this is an asynchronous operation.
- **Native Loading:** Pamir uses a native inline loading pattern. The project appears in the list immediately with a progress indicator and "Cloning..." status, allowing you to continue using the app while the operation completes in the background.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/project-clone-loading.png" 
    alt="Inline loading indicator" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## System Settings

The gear icon in the top right provides quick access to the system-wide settings for the active Distiller.

- **Hardware:** Configure display brightness, LED patterns, and audio levels.
- **Connectivity:** Manage Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth peripheral pairing.
- **Security:** Update device passwords and privacy permissions.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">

    alt="System settings menu" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Key UX Decisions

- **Instant Access:** We prioritize immediate navigation for synchronous operations (local folder/empty project) to make the app feel extremely fast.
- **Non-blocking Operations:** Asynchronous operations like Git clones use inline progress instead of full-screen overlays, matching the behavior of the iOS App Store.
- **Swipe Actions:** Standard iOS swipe-to-delete provides a familiar and efficient management interface.
