The Project List View is the central hub for managing your development environments. It follows native iOS design patterns to provide a responsive and clear user experience.

## Overview

The Project List View displays all projects associated with your active device. It supports quick searching, project deletion via swipe actions, and various creation methods.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">

    alt="Project List View main interface" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Device Management

Pamir allows you to manage multiple Distiller devices seamlessly from a single app instance.

### Switching Devices
You can switch between active devices using the device selector at the top of the project list. This instantly updates the list to show projects stored on the selected device.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/device-switcher.png" 
    alt="Device switching menu" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Adding a New Device
To add a new Distiller, tap the "Add Device" option in the device menu. This triggers the secure onboarding flow to pair your new hardware.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">

    alt="QR Scanning Sheet" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

For more details on the setup process, see [Onboarding Flow](./onboarding).

## Creating Projects

Pamir supports three primary ways to create projects, each optimized for speed and clarity.

### 1. Create Empty Project
Best for starting fresh. The app creates a managed directory on your device instantly.
- **UX Flow:** Instant feedback. The view navigates to the Project Overview immediately.

### 2. Open Local Folder
Allows you to bring existing code into the Pamir ecosystem.
- **UX Flow:** Uses the native Folder Picker. Navigation is instantaneous once a folder is selected.
- **Why are files disabled?** As an IDE-focused tool, Pamir requires a folder to establish a project root; selecting individual files is not supported. We show the files so the user can verify the contents of the directory they are adding, but we gray them out to prevent accidental selection and reinforce the "Folder as Project" requirement.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/folder-picker-sheet.png" 
    alt="Folder Picker Sheet" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### 3. Clone Git Repository
For projects hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or bitbucket.
- **UX Flow:** Unlike the other methods, this is an asynchronous operation.
- **Git Clone Sheet:** The user provides the repository URL and selects a branch.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/git-clone-sheet.png" 
    alt="Git Clone Sheet" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

- **Native Loading:** Pamir uses a native inline loading pattern. The project appears in the list immediately with a progress indicator and "Cloning..." status, allowing you to continue using the app while the operation completes in the background.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/project-clone-loading.png" 
    alt="Inline loading indicator" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## System Settings

The gear icon in the top right provides quick access to the system-wide settings for the active Distiller. These settings are grouped into three primary categories:

- **Connectivity**: Manage Wi-Fi network credentials and Bluetooth peripheral pairing. This is where you configure the device's communication channels.
- **Hardware**: Fine-tune the physical interface, including e-ink display (orientation, inversion), LED indicator patterns, and audio alert levels.
- **System**: Configure core system behavior, including security policies (SSH/Firewall), storage management, software updates, and developer-specific preferences.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/system-settings-menu.png" 
    alt="System settings menu" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

For a deep dive into each setting, see the [Connectivity](../connectivity/wifi), [Hardware](../hardware/display), and [System](../system/system) documentation folders.

## Key UX Decisions

- **Instant Access:** We prioritize immediate navigation for synchronous operations (local folder/empty project) to make the app feel extremely fast.
- **Non-blocking Operations:** Asynchronous operations like Git clones use inline progress instead of full-screen overlays, matching the behavior of the iOS App Store.
- **Swipe Actions:** Standard iOS swipe-to-delete provides a familiar and efficient management interface.
