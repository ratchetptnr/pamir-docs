The Desk provides visibility into the AI agent's internal processes for a specific Chat tab. Each Chat has its own Desk that shows what the agent is currently working on and maintains a history of completed tasks for that conversation.

## Overview

The Desk uses a native iOS grouped list design with two sections:

- **Current Action**: The agent's active task in this chat
- **Previous Activities**: Completed tasks from this chat's history

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/desk-main.png" 
    alt="The Desk main view" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
Think of The Desk as a "task monitor" that shows you what the agent is doing behind the scenes.
</Callout>

## Current Action

The Current Action section shows a prominent card with:

- **Task title**: High-level description (e.g., "Refining Chat Input Layout")
- **Live status**: A pulsing blue indicator showing active processing
- **Latest activity**: The most recent agent action (e.g., "THINK: Proposed fix...")

Tapping the active task opens a detail sheet showing all agent activities for this task.

## Previous Activities

This section lists all completed tasks from this specific Chat tab. Each item shows:

- **Task title**: What was completed
- **Timestamp**: When it finished
- **Status badge**: Completed, Failed, or other states

Tapping any history item opens its detail sheet.

## Task Detail Sheets

Both active and completed tasks can be tapped to view detailed activity logs in a modal sheet.

The detail sheet displays the task in a terminal-like format, showing all agent activities chronologically:

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/desk-detail-sheet.png" 
    alt="Task detail sheet" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Activity Types

Each activity is tagged with a type label:

- **GREP**: File search operations
- **READ**: Reading file contents
- **TEST**: Running tests or validation
- **DIFF**: Analyzing code changes
- **THINK**: Agent reasoning and planning
- **INFO**: General informational messages

### Activity Details

Some activities include additional detail text, such as:

- File paths and line numbers for READ operations
- Search patterns for GREP operations
- Test results and pass/fail counts

<Callout type="tip">
The detail view helps you understand exactly what the agent did during a task, which is useful for debugging or learning from the agent's approach.
</Callout>

## Navigation

Access The Desk from any Chat tab by tapping the **clipboard icon** in the top-right toolbar. Each Chat tab has its own dedicated Desk showing only the agent activities related to that conversation.

## Use Cases

The Desk is valuable when you want to:

- **Monitor progress**: See what the agent is doing right now
- **Review work**: Understand how the agent solved a problem
- **Debug issues**: Trace through the agent's actions if something went wrong
- **Learn patterns**: Observe the agent's problem-solving approach

<Callout type="info">
The Desk is a transparency feature—it shows you the agent's "thought process" rather than hiding it in a black box.
</Callout>
