The Project List View is the central hub for managing your development environments. It follows native iOS design patterns to provide a responsive and clear user experience.

## Overview

The Project List View displays all projects associated with your active device. It supports quick searching, project deletion via swipe actions, and various creation methods.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/project-list-view-main.png" 
    alt="Project List View main interface" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Device Management

Pamir allows you to manage multiple Distiller devices seamlessly from a single app instance.

### Switching Devices
You can switch between active devices using the device selector at the top of the project list. This instantly updates the list to show projects stored on the selected device.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/device-switcher.png" 
    alt="Device switching menu" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Adding a New Device
To add a new Distiller, tap the "Add Device" option in the device menu. This triggers the secure onboarding flow to pair your new hardware.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/onboarding-qr-scan.png" 
    alt="QR Scanning Sheet" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

For more details on the setup process, see [Onboarding Flow](./onboarding).

## Empty State

When no projects exist on the active device, Pamir displays a clean, native iOS empty state rather than a blank screen.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/project-list-empty-state.png" 
    alt="Empty state when no projects exist" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

**Design Rationale:**
- **Visual Consistency**: Uses the same `folder.badge.plus` icon as the toolbar button, creating a clear visual connection between the empty state and the creation action.
- **Clear Guidance**: Explicitly instructs users to tap the icon to get started, reducing friction for first-time users.
- **Native Pattern**: Follows iOS's `ContentUnavailableView` standard, matching the look and feel of apps like Files, Photos, and Notes.

**Search Results:**
When a search returns no matches, the view displays iOS's standard "No Results" empty state instead.

## Creating Projects

Pamir supports three primary ways to create projects, each optimized for speed and clarity.

### 1. Create Empty Project
Best for starting fresh. The app creates a managed directory on your device instantly.
- **UX Flow:** Instant feedback. The view navigates to the Project Overview immediately.

### 2. Open Local Folder
Allows you to bring existing code into the Pamir ecosystem.
- **UX Flow:** Uses the native Folder Picker. Navigation is instantaneous once a folder is selected.
- **Why are files disabled?** As an IDE-focused tool, Pamir requires a folder to establish a project root; selecting individual files is not supported. We show the files so the user can verify the contents of the directory they are adding, but we gray them out to prevent accidental selection and reinforce the "Folder as Project" requirement.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/folder-picker-sheet.png" 
    alt="Folder Picker Sheet" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### 3. Clone Git Repository

For projects hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, Pamir provides a professional Git cloning experience with support for private repository authentication.

#### Authentication Flow

**Per-Device Authentication:**  
Each Distiller device maintains its own GitHub authentication token. This means:
- When you switch from Distiller A → Distiller B, you may need to authenticate again
- Tokens are stored locally on each device and persist across app restarts
- This mirrors how professional Git clients (VS Code, GitHub Desktop) handle credentials

**Two States:**

1. **Unauthenticated Device** (First Time):
   - The clone sheet displays a clean authentication prompt: "🔒 Private repos require authentication"
   - Tapping "Sign in to GitHub" opens a Safari-style OAuth modal
   - After authentication, the device is authenticated and the modal auto-dismisses
   - The clone sheet returns to its clean state (no banner clutter)

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/git-clone-auth-prompt.png" 
    alt="Git authentication prompt for unauthenticated device" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

2. **Authenticated Device**:
   - No authentication banner is shown (keeps the UI clean)
   - Private repositories can be cloned immediately
   - The clone sheet follows standard native iOS patterns:
     - **Repository URL**: Auto-detects GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
     - **Project Name**: Auto-extracted from the URL (e.g., `mycompany/ios-app` → `ios-app`)
     - **Branch**: Defaults to `main` if left blank

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/git-clone-authenticated.png" 
    alt="Git clone sheet on authenticated device" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

#### Native Loading

Pamir uses a native inline loading pattern. The project appears in the list immediately with a progress indicator and "Cloning..." status, allowing you to continue using the app while the operation completes in the background.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/project-clone-loading.png" 
    alt="Inline loading indicator" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

#### Managing Git Settings

Authentication is intentionally **not** displayed in the clone sheet when authenticated (to avoid clutter). Instead, users manage their GitHub account through:

**Settings → Git**

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row justify-center items-center my-8 gap-4">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/git-settings-view.png" 
    alt="Git settings page showing unauthenticated state" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/git-settings-authenticated.png" 
    alt="Git settings page showing authenticated account" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

This settings page shows (WIP):
- Unauthenticated: Sign in prompt
- Authenticated: ✓ Signed in as @username with "Sign Out" button
- Future: Git configuration (user name, email, default branch)

This matches how professional IDEs bury authentication settings—developers rarely need to see them after initial setup.

## System Settings

The gear icon in the top right provides quick access to the system-wide settings for the active Distiller. These settings are grouped into three primary categories:

- **Connectivity**: Manage Wi-Fi network credentials and Bluetooth pairing. This is where you configure the device's communication channels.
- **Hardware**: Fine-tune the physical interface, including e-ink display (orientation, inversion), LED strip settings, and speaker volume.
- **System**: Configure core system behavior, including security policies (SSH/Firewall), storage management, software updates, and developer-specific preferences.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img 
    src="/docs/app/system-settings-menu.png" 
    alt="System settings menu" 
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

For a deep dive into each setting, see the [Connectivity](../connectivity/wifi), [Hardware](../hardware/display), and [System](../system/system) documentation folders. (Still working on docs)

## Key UX Decisions

- **Instant Access:** We prioritize immediate navigation for synchronous operations (local folder/empty project) to make the app feel extremely fast.
- **Non-blocking Operations:** Asynchronous operations like Git clones use inline progress instead of full-screen overlays, matching the behavior of the iOS App Store.
- **Swipe Actions:** Standard iOS swipe-to-delete provides a familiar and efficient management interface.
