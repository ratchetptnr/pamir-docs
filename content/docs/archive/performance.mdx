<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "Monitor, don't tinker." The best performance setting is one you don't have to touch. The device manages its own resources.
</Callout>

## Why No Performance Settings?

We deliberately excluded performance controls (overclocking, CPU governors, memory splits) from the user interface.

**1. Reliability over Speed**
The device is designed for stability. Letting users tweak voltages or clock speeds compromises that stability.

**2. Automatic Management**
The OS automatically scales CPU frequency based on load. It knows when to run fast and when to save power.

**3. It's an Appliance**
You don't tune the CPU on your refrigerator or smart speaker. You shouldn't have to tune it here either.

## What We Handle Automatically

| Feature | How We Handle It |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CPU Speed** | Dynamic scaling (ondemand governor) |
| **Throttling** | Automatic thermal protection |
| **Memory** | Intelligent swap management |
