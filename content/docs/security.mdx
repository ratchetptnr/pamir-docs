<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "Trust through verification." Security settings are dangerous. Enabling SSH or changing firewall rules can expose the device to attacks. We require authentication before users can even view these settings.
</Callout>

## The Authentication Gate

Before the security settings page loads, users must authenticate via:
- **Face ID** (iOS devices with Face ID)
- **Touch ID** (iOS devices with Touch ID)
- **Device Passcode** (fallback)

**Why?** These settings can compromise device security. Even *viewing* the current SSH port or firewall status could help an attacker. We treat this page like a bank app: authentication required.

**The flow**:
1. User taps "Security" in settings
2. iOS prompts: *"Authenticate to access security settings"*
3. User scans face/fingerprint or enters passcode
4. On success: Settings load
5. On failure: User can retry or cancel (returns to main settings)

## User-Controlled Settings

### SSH Access

**What it is**: Secure Shell (SSH) allows terminal access to the device over the network.

**The toggle**: On/Off (default: On)

**Why it's on by default**: Developers need SSH. It's the primary way to access the Linux environment, run commands, and debug projects.

**The port**: Hardcoded to **22** (standard SSH port). We show this read-only so users know where to connect.

**Why we don't allow port changes**: Changing SSH ports is a "security through obscurity" tactic. It doesn't meaningfully improve security (attackers scan all ports). It *does* make it harder for users to remember how to connect. We prioritize usability.

**The warning**: We show a security notice:
> *"Only enable SSH if you need remote access. Make sure you're using a strong password and trusted network."*

**Why?** SSH is powerful. If someone gains access, they control the device. Users should understand the risk.

## Read-Only Settings

### Firewall

**What it shows**: *"Firewall: Enabled"* with a green checkmark

**Why it's read-only**: The firewall is always on. It blocks unauthorized incoming connections while allowing outbound traffic and established connections.

**Why we don't allow toggling**: Users might disable the firewall thinking it "speeds things up" or "fixes a connection issue." In reality, it just exposes the device to attacks. We make this decision for them.

**The message**: *"Firewall is always enabled to protect your device from unauthorized network access."*

## What We Excluded (and Why)

These settings exist in the underlying OS but were deliberately hidden.

| Setting | Why Excluded |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SSH Port** | Standard is 22. Changing it adds complexity without real security benefit. Advanced users can edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` manually. |
| **Firewall Rules** | Too technical. Users would need to understand ports, protocols, and IP ranges. We configure sane defaults (allow SSH, HTTP/HTTPS, block everything else). |
| **Password Management** | Device password is set during onboarding. Changing it is a separate flow (future feature). |
| **Session Timeout** | Only relevant for web dashboards. The iOS app uses persistent tokens. No need to expose this. |

## The Security Model

### Defense in Depth

We employ multiple layers:

1. **Firewall** (always on): Blocks unauthorized inbound connections
2. **SSH Password**: Even if firewall allows SSH, users need the device password
3. **Authentication for Settings**: Can't even *view* security settings without Face ID/passcode
4. **BLE Security**: Covered in [Bluetooth documentation](/docs/bluetooth)

**Why multiple layers?** No single layer is perfect. Firewall could be bypassed via a compromised local network. SSH password could be brute-forced (though we rate-limit attempts). Authentication for settings prevents shoulder-surfing or unauthorized access to the phone itself.

## States of Mind

How users interact with security settings based on their needs.

| User Scenario | Settings Pattern |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"I need to SSH into the device"** | SSH: On, connect to device IP:22 |
| **"I'm done developing, want to lock it down"** | SSH: Off, firewall remains on |
| **"I'm on an untrusted network"** | SSH: Off (disable remote access entirely) |
| **"I want to check if firewall is protecting me"** | View firewall status (always "Enabled") |

---

## Design Principles

1. **Authentication is mandatory**: No bypassing Face ID/Touch ID. If authentication fails, users don't see these settings.
2. **Defaults should be secure**: Firewall always on, SSH on (because developers need it, but with password protection).
3. **Read-only where appropriate**: Users can't disable the firewall. It's for their own good.
4. **Warnings over blocks**: We allow SSH (with a warning) rather than blocking it entirely. Power users need access; we just make sure they know the risk.
5. **No false security**: We don't expose port changes or obscure firewall rules that give a false sense of security. We focus on real protections: encryption, passwords, firewalls.
