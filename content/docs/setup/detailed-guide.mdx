import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'
import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion'

This guide walks you through every step of setting up your Distiller, with detailed explanations of what's happening at each stage.

---

## Before You Start

**What You Need:**
- Your Distiller (unboxed and plugged in)
- Your smartphone (iOS or Android)
- WiFi network name and password
- 5 minutes of time

**Important Notes:**
- Your Distiller supports **2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi**
- Keep your phone near the device during setup
- Bluetooth must be enabled on your phone

---

## Step 1: Power On the Device

**What to do:**
1. Plug in your Distiller to power
2. Wait 10-15 seconds for the device to boot

**On Device Display:**

```
First, you'll see:
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   Pamir Distiller   │
│                     │
│   Starting...       │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

```
Then, after 10 seconds:
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   No Internet       │
│                     │
│   [QR CODE]         │
│                     │
│   Scan to connect   │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

<Callout>
**What's happening:** The device is in "recovery mode" - it's looking for WiFi but doesn't have credentials yet. The QR code is how you'll tell it which network to use.
</Callout>

**The QR code will stay on screen until you complete setup.** No timeout - take your time.

---

## Step 2: Download and Open the App

**What to do:**
1. Open your phone's camera app
2. Point it at the QR code
3. Wait for the notification
4. Tap the notification

**On Your Phone:**

```
Camera detects QR:
┌────────────────────────┐
│ 📷                     │
│                        │
│  [Viewing QR Code]     │
│                        │
│  Open "Distiller App"  │ ← Tap this
│                        │
└────────────────────────┘
```

**What happens next depends on whether you have the app:**

**If App Already Installed:**
- App opens immediately
- Shows "Searching for devices..." screen

**If App NOT Installed:**
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ App Store              │
│                        │
│ Distiller              │
│ by Pamir               │
│                        │
│    [GET]               │ ← Tap to download
└────────────────────────┘
```
- Download the app (takes ~30 seconds)
- App opens automatically after install

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** The QR code only opens the app - it doesn't connect to your device. The connection happens in the next step.
</Callout>

---

## Step 3: Find Your Device via Bluetooth

**On Your Phone:**

First, the app checks if Bluetooth is enabled:

```
If Bluetooth is OFF:
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️ Bluetooth Required    │
│                          │
│ Bluetooth must be on to  │
│ connect to your device.  │
│                          │
│ [Open Settings]          │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

If you see this, tap "Open Settings" and enable Bluetooth, then return to the app.

**If Bluetooth is ON, app searches automatically:**

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Searching for devices... │
│                          │
│        ○ ○ ○             │ ← Animated
│                          │
│ Make sure your Distiller │
│ is powered on and nearby │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**Within 5-15 seconds, your device appears:**

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Found Distillers         │
│                          │
│ ○ Distiller-A4F2  ━━━━━ │ ← Strong signal
│   Serial: A4F2           │
│   Distance: Very close   │
│                          │
│ ○ Distiller-B8C9  ━━    │ ← Weak signal
│   Serial: B8C9           │
│   Distance: Far          │
│                          │
│ [Scan Again]             │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**What to do:**
- Look for the device with the **strongest signal** (most bars)
- Check the serial number matches your device (if visible on device)
- Tap the device to connect

<Callout>
**Multiple devices?** If you see several Distillers, the one with the strongest signal is usually yours. You can also check the serial number on the back of your device.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Pair via Bluetooth

**On Device Display:**

When you tap to connect, device shows:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   Bluetooth         │
│   Pairing           │
│                     │
│   PIN: 1234         │
│                     │
│   Enter on phone    │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

```

**What to do:**
1. Look at your device's screen - note the PIN (e.g., "1234")
2. Enter that PIN in the app
3. Tap "Connect"

**On Your Phone (after entering correct PIN):**

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Connected              │
│                          │
│ Bluetooth link           │
│ established              │
│                          │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**On Device Display:**

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   Bluetooth         │
│   Connected ✓       │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

<Callout type="warn">
**Wrong PIN?** If you enter the wrong PIN, you'll see an error. Just check the device screen again and re-enter the correct PIN. You have 5 attempts.
</Callout>

---

## Step 5: Name Your Device

**On Your Phone:**

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Name your Distiller      │
│                          │
│ Give it a name you'll    │
│ recognize:               │
│                          │
│ [My Distiller        ]   │
│                          │
│ Examples:                │
│ • Kitchen Distiller      │
│ • Lab Device 1           │
│ • Office Pamir           │
│                          │
│      [Next]              │

│                     │
│   Step 1 of 2       │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**What to do:**
- Enter a name you'll remember
- This is how the device will appear in the app
- You can change it later in settings

**Tips:**
- Use a descriptive name if you have multiple devices
- Keep it short (fits better on small screens)
- Avoid special characters

---

## Step 6: Set Device Password

**On Your Phone:**

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Protect your device      │
│                          │
│ Create a password to     │
│ prevent unauthorized     │
│ access:                  │
│                          │
│ Password: [••••••••]     │
│ Confirm:  [••••••••]     │
│                          │
│ Requirements:            │
│ • At least 6 characters  │
│                          │
│      [Next]              │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**On Device Display:**

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │

│                     │
│   Step 2 of 2       │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**What to do:**
1. Enter a secure password (at least 6 characters)
2. Confirm by entering it again
3. Tap "Next"

<Callout type="warn">
**Important:** Remember this password! You'll need it if you ever need to reconnect the device to WiFi or change settings.
</Callout>

**Why is this needed?**
- Anyone with Bluetooth can discover your device
- The password prevents strangers from accessing it
- It's like the lock screen on your phone

---

## Step 7: Connect to WiFi

**On Your Phone:**

App automatically scans for WiFi networks:

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Scanning for networks... │
│                          │
│        ○ ○ ○             │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

Then shows available networks:

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Available Networks       │
│                          │
│ ○ HomeNetwork     ━━━━━ │ ← Strong
│   2.4GHz                 │
│                          │
│ ○ OfficeWiFi      ━━━   │ ← Medium
│   2.4GHz                 │
│                          │
│ ○ Guest           ━     │ ← Weak
│   2.4GHz                 │
│                          │
│ [Network not listed?]    │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**What to do:**
1. Find your WiFi network in the list
2. Tap on it
3. Enter your WiFi password

```
After tapping network:
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Connect to HomeNetwork   │
│                          │
│ Password:                │
│ [****************]       │
│                          │
│ ☑ Show password          │
│                          │
│      [Connect]           │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

<Callout type="info">
**Network not listed?** Tap "Network not listed?" to enter the network name (SSID) manually. Your Distiller supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks.
</Callout>

**On Device Display (while connecting):**

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   Connecting to     │
│   HomeNetwork...    │
│                     │
│   ●●●○○○           │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

This takes 10-30 seconds depending on your network.

---

## Step 8: Verify Connection

**What happens behind the scenes:**

The device does TWO checks before declaring success:

1. **WiFi Connection:** Can it join the network?
2. **Internet Verification:** Can it reach the internet?

This is important because WiFi can work while internet is down.

**On Device Display (checking internet):**

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   WiFi Connected    │
│                     │
│   Checking          │
│   internet...       │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**If everything succeeds:**

**On Device Display:**

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│   Connected ✓       │
│                     │
│   IP: 192.168.1.42  │
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**On Your Phone:**

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Setup Complete!        │
│                          │
│ Your Distiller is online │
│ and ready to use.        │
│                          │
│ Status: Connected        │
│ WiFi: HomeNetwork        │
│ Signal: Strong           │
│                          │
│      [Get Started]       │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

<Callout type="success">
**Success!** Your Distiller is now connected to WiFi and can access the internet. The Bluetooth connection will automatically close.
</Callout>

---

## What Happens After Setup?

**Device Display:**
- Shows dashboard with system status
- Displays IP address
- No longer shows QR code

**App:**
- Shows your device as "Online"
- Green status indicator
- You can now access all features

**Bluetooth:**
