<Callout type="warn" title="Under Consideration">
  This feature set is currently being refined. We are evaluating which dev tools should be exposed on-device versus kept in the CLI/SDK.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "Power when you need it." Advanced tools are hidden by default to keep the experience clean, but available for those who need to dig deeper.
</Callout>

## Proposed Settings

### Developer Mode
A master toggle that unlocks advanced diagnostics and logging features.

### Show API Docs
Displays the local SDK documentation URL on the screen for quick reference.

### Debug Logging
Increases the verbosity of system logs for troubleshooting issues.
