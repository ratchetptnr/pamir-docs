## Why No Notification Settings on Device?

Notifications are handled entirely by the iOS/Android app, not the device's embedded OS.

**1. The Phone is the Proxy**
The device itself doesn't "notify" you (no speakers, no flashing lights). It sends a signal to the cloud, which pushes a notification to your phone.

**2. App-Level Control**
Since notifications appear on your phone, you manage them in your phone's system settings (Settings > Notifications > Distiller), not inside the device's specialized settings menu.

**3. Critical Events Only**
We only push notifications for:
*   **Agent Requests**: "I need permission to proceed."
*   **Critical Health**: "Device is overheating."

These are non-negotiable for the device's operation, so there are no granular toggles to accidental disable them.
