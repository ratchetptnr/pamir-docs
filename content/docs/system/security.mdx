<Callout type="warn" title="Under Consideration">
  This feature set is currently being refined. We are balancing the need for security with the need for frictionless access.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "Trust through verification." Security settings are dangerous. Enabling SSH or changing firewall rules can expose the device to attacks. We require account-based authentication before users can even view these settings.
</Callout>

## The Authentication Gate

Before the security settings page loads, users must authenticate via:
- **Registered Account Ownership** (Google or Apple)
- **Face ID / Touch ID** (On your smartphone via the app)

**Why?** These settings can compromise device security. Even *viewing* the current SSH port or firewall status could help an attacker. We treat this page like a bank app: authentication required.

**The flow**:
1. User taps "Security" in settings
2. App verifies the registered account token
3. iOS prompts for biometric auth (*Face ID/Touch ID*)
4. On success: Settings load
5. On failure: User is denied access

## User-Controlled Settings

### SSH Access

**What it is**: Secure Shell (SSH) allows terminal access to the device over the network.

**The toggle**: On/Off (default: On)

**Why it's on by default**: Developers need SSH. It's the primary way to access the Linux environment, run commands, and debug projects.

**The port**: Hardcoded to **22** (standard SSH port). We show this read-only so users know where to connect.

**The warning**: We show a security notice:
> *"Only enable SSH if you need remote access. Secure your connection by using your registered account credentials."*

## Read-Only Settings

### Firewall

**What it shows**: *"Firewall: Enabled"* with a green checkmark

**Why it's read-only**: The firewall is always on. It blocks unauthorized incoming connections while allowing outbound traffic and established connections.

**Why we don't allow toggling**: Users might disable the firewall thinking it "speeds things up" or "fixes a connection issue." In reality, it just exposes the device to attacks. We make this decision for them.

**The message**: *"Firewall is always enabled to protect your device from unauthorized network access."*

## What We Excluded (and Why)

| Setting | Why Excluded |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SSH Port** | Standard is 22. Changing it adds complexity without real security benefit. |
| **Firewall Rules** | Too technical. We configure sane defaults (allow SSH, HTTP/HTTPS, block everything else). |
| **Password Management** | Device passwords are eliminated in favor of account-based ownership. Only the registered account owner can manage the device. |
| **Session Timeout** | Only relevant for web dashboards. The iOS app uses persistent tokens. No need to expose this. |

## The Security Model

### Defense in Depth

We employ multiple layers:

1. **Firewall** (always on): Blocks unauthorized inbound connections
2. **Account Ownership**: Device only accepts commands from the app which has the registered account
3. **Authentication for Settings**: Can't even *view* security settings without biometrics
4. **BLE Security**: Covered in [Bluetooth documentation](/docs/bluetooth)

---

## Design Principles

1. **Authentication is mandatory**: No bypassing biometrics/account verification.
2. **Defaults should be secure**: Firewall always on, SSH on (with account-based protection).
3. **Read-only where appropriate**: Users can't disable core protections.
4. **Warnings over blocks**: We allow SSH (with a warning) rather than blocking it entirely.
5. **No false security**: We focus on real protections: encryption, account ownership, firewalls.
