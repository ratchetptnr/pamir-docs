<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "Stay current, stay safe." Software updates should be transparent and user-controlled. We check for updates automatically, but users approve installation. No surprise reboots, no forced updates.
</Callout>

## The Update Journey

Updates serve two purposes:
1. **Security**: Patch vulnerabilities, fix bugs
2. **Features**: New capabilities, performance improvements

**The user's concern**: *"Will this break my projects?"*

**Our promise**: Updates are explicit. You'll know what's available, what it does, and when it installs.

---

## User-Controlled Settings

### Auto-Check for Updates

**What it does**: Periodically checks (every 24 hours) if a new version is available.

**The toggle**: On/Off (default: On)

**The philosophy**: Checking is harmless and low-bandwidth. Most users want to know when updates exist, even if they don't install immediately.

**Why not auto-install?** Trust. The device is running user code. An update mid-project could cause issues. Users should control when the device reboots and re-provisions.

### Current Version

**What it shows**: Current software version (e.g., `1.0.2`)

**Why it matters**: When reporting bugs or asking for help, "What version are you on?" is the first question. Making this visible saves time.

### Last Checked

**What it shows**: Timestamp of last update check (e.g., `Jan 6, 2026, 6:32 PM`)

**Why it matters**: If auto-check is on, users want reassurance that it's actually working. If the timestamp is weeks old, something's wrong.

### Check for Updates Now

**What it does**: Immediately queries the update server for new versions.

**The action**: Button with loading state (*"Checking for Updates..."*)

**The philosophy**: Some users disable auto-check (bandwidth concerns, offline dev). They still need a manual way to pull updates when they're ready.

## The Update States

The UI adapts based on update availability:

### State 1: Up to Date

**What you see**:
- Green checkmark icon
- Message: *"Your Distiller is up to date"*
- "Check for Updates" button

**User perception**: *"Nothing to do. I'm current."*

### State 2: Checking

**What you see**:
- Spinner icon
- Message: *"Checking for Updates..."*
- Button is disabled

**User perception**: *"The system is working. Wait a moment."*

### State 3: Update Available

**What you see**:
- Blue download icon
- Message: *"Update Available — Version 1.1.0 is ready to install"*
- "Install Update" button (actionable)

**User perception**: *"New version exists. I can install when ready."*

## What We Excluded (and Why)

These settings exist in other update systems but were deliberately hidden.

| Setting | Why Excluded |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Update Channel** (Stable/Beta) | Adds complexity. Most users should be on Stable. Beta testers are advanced enough to switch via command line or developer settings. |
| **Auto-Install** | Dangerous. The device could reboot mid-task. Users must approve install timing. |
| **Rollback** | Not exposed yet. Future feature. When we build this, it'll appear here. |

---

## States of Mind

How users interact with updates based on their workflow.

| User Scenario | Settings Pattern |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"I want to stay current automatically"** | Auto-Check: On, manually install when notified |
| **"I'm offline for weeks at a time"** | Auto-Check: Off, use "Check Now" when online |
| **"I'm actively developing code"** | Auto-Check: On, delay install until project is stable |
| **"Update broke something"** | (Future: Rollback option will appear here) |

---

## The Install Flow (Future Detail)

When the user taps "Install Update," the following happens:
1. **Download**: Update package is fetched (progress bar shown)
2. **Verification**: Checksum is validated (prevent corrupted installs)
3. **Install**: Package is applied
4. **Reboot**: Device restarts to complete installation
5. **Verification**: New version is confirmed on next boot

**User control**: They tap "Install Update" and see progress. The reboot is expected, not a surprise.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Transparency**: Users always know what version they're on and when updates exist.
2. **Control**: Checking is automatic. Installing is manual. Trust over convenience.
3. **Safety**: No silent updates. No forced reboots. Users approve timing.
4. **Simplicity**: One button: "Check for Updates." One action: "Install Update." No cryptic version numbers or release notes (unless users tap for details).
5. **Offline-friendly**: Users can disable auto-check if they're bandwidth-constrained or working offline. Manual check is always available.
