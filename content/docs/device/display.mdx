<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "Show what matters, hide what doesn't." The E-ink display is the device's face to the world. We expose only the settings that meaningfully change the user's experience, not the underlying API knobs.
</Callout>

## The Display as Interface

The E-ink screen is not just a component—it's the primary feedback mechanism when the device operates headless. Unlike traditional screens, E-ink has unique characteristics: high readability in sunlight, zero power consumption when static, but slow refresh rates.

**Our approach**: Embrace these constraints. Expose settings that align with how users actually position and use the device.

## User-Controlled Settings

These are the settings we chose to expose. Each represents a real user need.

### Screen Orientation

**Why it matters**: Users mount the device in different orientations—horizontal on a desk, vertical on a wall, rotated in a custom enclosure.

**The options**: 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°

**The philosophy**: Let the user match the physical world. The device doesn't know if it's upside down; the orientation setting is the user saying *"This is how I see you."*

### Invert Colors

**Why it matters**: Some users prefer white-on-black for aesthetic or readability reasons, especially in low-light environments.

**The toggle**: Normal ↔ Inverted

**The philosophy**: A simple preference toggle. No performance impact, pure aesthetics.

### Screen Timeout

**Why it matters**: E-ink doesn't need to "turn off" to save power (static images are free). But users might want the screen to sleep after inactivity for privacy or to reduce visual clutter.

**The options**: 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, Never

**The philosophy**: Default to 5 minutes (unobtrusive). "Never" is available for users who want persistent dashboards.

## What We Excluded (and Why)

These settings exist in the underlying SDK but were deliberately hidden from users.

| Setting | Why Excluded |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Firmware Type** | This is hardware detection, not a user setting. The device knows what display it has. |
| **Scaling Method** | Technical implementation detail. The device should intelligently fit content to screen. |
| **Dithering Quality** | Too technical. Users don't think in terms of dithering algorithms; they think in terms of "looks good" or "doesn't." We choose smart defaults. |
| **Flip Horizontal/Vertical** | Edge case. Orientation handles 99% of use cases. Adding these clutters the UI for negligible benefit. |

## States of Mind

How users perceive the display based on their settings choices.

| User Goal | Settings Pattern |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"I want a persistent dashboard"** | Timeout: Never, Refresh: Normal |
| **"I want privacy when idle"** | Timeout: 1 minute, Invert: Off |
| **"I mounted it sideways"** | Orientation: 90°, Refresh: Normal |
| **"I prefer dark mode"** | Invert: On, Timeout: 5 minutes |

## Design Principles

1. **Physical trumps digital**: Orientation is about matching the real world, not rotating pixels for fun.
2. **Defaults should disappear**: Most users never touch these settings. That's a success metric.
3. **E-ink is patient**: Unlike LCD, there's no urgency to "turn off" the screen. Timeout is about user preference, not battery life.
