<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "Speak without words." LEDs are ambient communication. They tell you the device's state at a glance—across the room, from your desk, without opening an app. We expose color meanings and brightness because context matters.
</Callout>

## The Seven Lights

The Distiller device has **7 RGB LEDs** arranged in a horizontal strip above the E-ink display. Unlike system status LEDs (power, activity), these are programmable indicators designed to communicate device and agent state.

This linear arrangement is visible at a glance from across the room—whether the device is on your desk, a shelf, or mounted on a wall. The strip provides clear ambient feedback without requiring you to open an app or approach the device.

**The challenge**: How do you give users control without overwhelming them with 21 color pickers (7 LEDs × 3 states)?

**Our solution**: Abstract to *state colors*, not *LED IDs*.

## User-Controlled Settings

### Master Toggle

**Why it matters**: Some environments (bedrooms, offices with strict policies) can't have blinking lights.

**The control**: LED Indicators On/Off

**The cascade**: When off, all other controls are disabled and grayed out. The hierarchy is clear: master switch controls everything below.

### Global Brightness

**Why it matters**: A dim room vs bright office. What's "subtle" in one context is "invisible" in another.

**The control**: Slider (0-100%)

**The philosophy**: One brightness for all LEDs. Users don't think "LED 3 should be dimmer than LED 5." They think "The lights are too bright."

### Status Colors

The LED strip communicates **agent state only**. Everything else (recording, playback, volume) is shown on the E-ink display.

| State | Default Color | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Idle** | Off | Agent dormant, no active tasks (power saving) |
| **Working** | Green | Agent is autonomously executing tasks |
| **Needs You** | Blue | Agent blocked, requires user input or permission |
| **Error** | Red | Agent encountered a problem, needs attention |

**Why these colors?**
- **Off** = Power efficient. If nothing is happening, why waste energy?
- **Green** = Universal "go" signal. Agent is working.
- **Blue** = Calm notification. "Hey, I need you"—informative, not alarming.
- **Red** = Universal "stop/danger" signal. Something broke.

**The philosophy**: The LEDs answer one question: *"What is my agent doing right now?"* The E-ink display handles everything else.

**The color pickers**: We use iOS native color pickers. Users can customize to match their desk setup, accessibility needs, or personal preference.

## What We Excluded (and Why)

The underlying SDK has extensive LED control. We deliberately hid most of it.

| Setting | Why Excluded |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Active LEDs** (which of the 7 to use) | Too granular. Users don't care about "LED 0-6." They care about "the strip of lights." |
| **Animation Modes** (blink, fade, rainbow, heartbeat) | Fun for demos, distracting for daily use. If the device is constantly pulsing, users tune it out. We prioritize static, meaningful states. |
| **Animation Timing** | If we had animations, this would matter. Since we don't, it's irrelevant. |
| **Per-LED Configuration** | Power user feature that adds massive UI complexity. 99% of users would never touch this. |

## The Information Hierarchy

When LEDs are disabled, the entire settings page becomes "read-only":
- Brightness slider is grayed out
- Color pickers are disabled
- Visual opacity drops to 50%

**Why?** Users shouldn't be able to configure settings for a feature that's turned off. It creates confusion: *"I changed the color, but nothing happened!"*

## States of Mind

How users approach LED settings based on their environment.

| User Context | Settings Pattern |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"I want subtle indicators at night"** | Enabled, Brightness: 20%, Colors: Default |
| **"I need high visibility across the room"** | Enabled, Brightness: 90%, Recording: Bright Red |
| **"No lights allowed (bedroom/office)"** | Disabled (all controls grayed out) |
| **"I want to match my desk theme"** | Enabled, Brightness: 60%, Idle: Purple (custom) |

## Design Principles

1. **Ambient, not intrusive**: LEDs should inform, not demand attention. Static colors, not flashing animations.
2. **State over decoration**: We don't expose rainbow modes or breathing effects. The LEDs serve a purpose: communicate device state.
3. **One brightness to rule them all**: Users think holistically. They don't want to individually dim 7 LEDs.
4. **Master switch matters**: Some users need zero light pollution. The toggle must be absolute—when off, truly off.
5. **Familiar colors**: Default to universal conventions (red = recording, orange = warning). Allow customization, but start with what works.
