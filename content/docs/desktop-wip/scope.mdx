description: What the desktop app ships with — and what it doesn't.

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

<Callout title="The Contract">
  The desktop app is a **tunnel manager**, not an IDE. Every feature must serve the goal of connecting the user's existing tools to their Distiller device. If it doesn't serve that goal, it doesn't belong here.
</Callout>

## What Ships

### Connection Management

| Feature | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SSH tunnel establishment** | Connects to the Distiller device over SSH and maintains the connection |
| **Auto port discovery** | Detects services running on the device and creates local port forwards automatically |
| **Manual port forwarding** | Users can add custom tunnels for ports the auto-detection misses |
| **Connection monitoring** | Live latency display, connection status, automatic reconnection |
| **Multi-device support** | Pair and switch between multiple Distiller devices |

### Tunnel Interface (Tray Popover)

| Feature | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Device selector** | Dropdown showing all paired devices with connection status |
| **Access section** | SSH connection details with one-click "Open in IDE" buttons |
| **Services section** | Auto-populated list of forwarded ports with copy and open-in-browser actions |
| **Custom tunnel** | Expandable form to add manual port forwards |
| **Status line** | Connection state, latency, tunnel count — always visible |

### SSH Access

| Feature | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SSH host** | A copyable hostname (e.g. `distiller-8x29`) that works in any IDE with SSH remote support |
| **SSH config management** | App writes and maintains `~/.ssh/config` entries so `ssh distiller-8x29` just works |
| **Copy to clipboard** | One-click copy of the SSH host for pasting into VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, or any tool |

### Device Management

| Feature | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Onboarding** | Sign in (Apple/Google) + BLE device pairing + WiFi setup |
| **Recovery** | BLE-based WiFi recovery when device loses connection |
| **Device settings** | Rename device, view connectivity info, manage WiFi |
| **Add/remove devices** | Pair new devices, unpair existing ones |

### App Management

| Feature | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auto-launch** | Option to start on login |
| **Auto-connect** | Reconnects to last-used device on launch |
| **Updates** | Self-update mechanism |

---

## What Doesn't Ship

| Feature | Why it's excluded |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Chat / AI interface** | Use Claude Code through your IDE terminal. The desktop has proper terminals — no need to rebuild one. |
| **Built-in terminal** | SSH tunnel provides full terminal access through any terminal app. |
| **Built-in editor** | Use VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, vim — whatever you want. |
| **Project management** | Projects are managed through the IDE or through chat in the terminal. |
| **Provider setup** | Configure Claude/OpenClaw via the device terminal in your IDE. Not needed in the tunnel manager. |
| **Hardware settings** (LED, display, audio) | Managed through the iOS app. These are physical device controls that belong on mobile. |
| **The Desk** (agent monitor) | Future capability, not part of this scope. |
| **Shadow Agent / Timeline** | Future capability. |
| **File browser** | Your IDE handles this natively via the SSH remote connection. |

## Quality Bar

Same standards as the iOS app, derived from [First Principles](/docs/design/first-principles).

### Failure States Are Designed

Every connection state has a clear, informative UI:

| State | What the user sees |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Connected** | Green dot, latency, tunnel count |
| **Connecting** | "Connecting to Distiller 1..." with progress |
| **Connection lost** | "Connection lost at 3:42 PM. Reconnecting..." with attempt count |
| **Device offline** | "Distiller 1 is offline. Last seen 2 hours ago." with recovery option |
| **BLE recovery needed** | "WiFi recovery available via Bluetooth" with action button |
| **No devices** | Clean empty state guiding to "Add Device" |

### Three-Part Error Messages

When something goes wrong:

| Do | Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| "SSH connection refused. Port 22 is not responding on the device. Check that the device is online in Settings." | "Connection failed." |
| "Tunnel to port 3000 closed unexpectedly. The service may have stopped. Tunnel will auto-restart when the service resumes." | "Tunnel error." |
| "BLE pairing failed — device not found. Make sure you're within 3 meters and the device is in setup mode." | "Pairing failed. Try again." |

### Copy Is Direct

| Do | Don't |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Device offline since 3:42 PM" | "Oops! Having trouble reaching your device" |
| "3 tunnels active" | "Your tunnels are all set!" |
| "Connection lost. Reconnecting (attempt 3)." | "Hmm, we seem to have lost the connection" |
