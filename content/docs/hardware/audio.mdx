<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "Hardware fades into the background." Audio should just work. We expose volume and mic gain because users have different environments—loud offices, quiet bedrooms, close-talk vs far-field recording. Everything else is automatic.
</Callout>

## The Audio Reality

The Distiller device has a microphone and speaker. These serve two purposes:
1. **Input**: Recording voice commands, ambient audio for AI agent context
2. **Output**: Text-to-speech feedback, alerts, confirmations

Unlike a studio recording setup, users don't think in terms of sample rates or buffer sizes. They think: *"Is it too loud?"* or *"Can it hear me?"*

## User-Controlled Settings

### Speaker Volume

**Why it matters**: User environments vary. A quiet home office vs a bustling coffee shop.

**The control**: Slider (0-100%)

**The philosophy**: Linear, obvious. No need for presets or curves. Users know what "louder" means.

### Microphone Gain

**Why it matters**: Distance from device, room acoustics, and voice volume vary wildly. Too much gain = background noise. Too little = missed words.

**The control**: Slider (0-100%)

**The philosophy**: Hardware calibration. "My room is quiet/loud".

### Text-to-Speech (System Voice)

**Why it matters**: The device's personality. Who speaks back to me?

**The options**: Amy, Ryan, Neural (Cloud)

**The philosophy**: Personal preference. Users should choose the voice that feels right to them.

### Mute Microphone

**Why it matters**: Privacy. When not using voice features, users want certainty that the mic is off.

**The hierarchy**: Mute is the parent control. When muted, the gain slider is disabled and grayed out.

**The philosophy**: Clear information architecture. You can't adjust gain when the mic is dead.

## What We Excluded (and Why)

These settings exist in the audio stack but were deliberately hidden.

| Setting | Why Excluded |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sample Rate** | Too technical. 16kHz is optimal for voice. Users shouldn't need to think about this. |
| **Channels** | Mono vs stereo should be automatic based on task. Voice commands? Mono. Music playback? Stereo. |
| **Buffer Size** | Latency vs stability tradeoff. We choose smart defaults (4096 samples). Users would have no mental model for this. |
| **Audio Device** | The device has one mic and one speaker. Auto-detection is sufficient. |
| **Voice Activity Detection** | Should be on by default for voice commands. Not a user-facing toggle. |

## The Haptic Guide

The mic gain slider has a unique interaction: when you drag it near 50%, it **snaps** to that value with a medium haptic pulse. If you cross the 50% threshold (moving up or down), you feel a lighter haptic tap.

**Why?** 50% is the calibrated default. Most users should start there. The snap behavior:
- **Guides** new users to the sweet spot
- **Reassures** experienced users they're at a known-good value
- **Feels intentional**, not arbitrary

## States of Mind

How users approach audio based on their needs.

| User Scenario | Settings Pattern |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"I'm using voice commands nearby"** | Volume: 70%, Mic Gain: 50%, Mute: Off |
| **"The agent is too loud"** | Volume: 30%, Mic Gain: unchanged |
| **"I'm in a noisy room"** | Mic Gain: 70-80% (closer to device) |
| **"I need privacy"** | Mute: On (gain disabled) |

## Design Principles

1. **Volume is obvious**: Everyone knows what a volume slider does. Don't overcomplicate it.
2. **Gain needs guidance**: Unlike volume, gain is less intuitive. The snap point educates.
3. **Mute means dead**: When muted, don't just visually disable the gain slider—make it immutable. The hierarchy must be crystal clear.
4. **Hardware transparency**: Users shouldn't think about audio devices or sample rates. They should think about "Can it hear me?" and "Is it too loud?"
