<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "Speak without words." LEDs are ambient communication. They tell you the device's state at a glance—across the room, from your desk, without opening an app. We expose color meanings and brightness because context matters.
</Callout>

## The Seven Lights

The Distiller device has **7 RGB LEDs** arranged in a horizontal strip above the E-ink display. Unlike system status LEDs (power, activity), these are programmable indicators designed to communicate device and agent state.

This linear arrangement is visible at a glance from across the room—whether the device is on your desk, a shelf, or mounted on a wall. The strip provides clear ambient feedback without requiring you to open an app or approach the device.

**The challenge**: How do you give users control without overwhelming them with 21 color pickers (7 LEDs × 3 states)?

**Our solution**: Abstract to *state colors*, not *LED IDs*.

## User-Controlled Settings

### Stealth Mode

**Why it matters**: Some environments (bedrooms, offices with strict policies) can't have blinking lights.

**The control**: Toggle (On/Off)

**The philosophy**: "I am sleeping. No lights." User preference trumps system feedback.

### Brightness

**Why it matters**: A dim room vs bright office. What's "subtle" in one context is "invisible" in another.

**The control**: Slider (0-100%)

**The philosophy**: One brightness for all LEDs.

### Idle Color

**Why it matters**: Personalization. What color is the device when it's "resting"?

**The control**: Color Picker

**The philosophy**: "What color is 'resting'?" Customization for the device's default state.

## What We Excluded (and Why)

The underlying SDK has extensive LED control. We deliberately hid most of it.

| Setting | Why Excluded |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Active LEDs** (which of the 7 to use) | Too granular. Users don't care about "LED 0-6." They care about "the strip of lights." |
| **Animation Modes** (blink, fade, rainbow, heartbeat) | Fun for demos, distracting for daily use. If the device is constantly pulsing, users tune it out. We prioritize static, meaningful states. |
| **Animation Timing** | If we had animations, this would matter. Since we don't, it's irrelevant. |
| **Per-LED Configuration** | Power user feature that adds massive UI complexity. 99% of users would never touch this. |

## The Information Hierarchy

When LEDs are disabled, the entire settings page becomes "read-only":
- Brightness slider is grayed out
- Color pickers are disabled
- Visual opacity drops to 50%

**Why?** Users shouldn't be able to configure settings for a feature that's turned off. It creates confusion: *"I changed the color, but nothing happened!"*

## States of Mind

How users approach LED settings based on their environment.

| User Context | Settings Pattern |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"I want subtle indicators at night"** | Enabled, Brightness: 20%, Colors: Default |
| **"I need high visibility across the room"** | Enabled, Brightness: 90%, Recording: Bright Red |
| **"No lights allowed (bedroom/office)"** | Disabled (all controls grayed out) |
| **"I want to match my desk theme"** | Enabled, Brightness: 60%, Idle: Purple (custom) |

## Design Principles

1. **Ambient, not intrusive**: LEDs should inform, not demand attention. Static colors, not flashing animations.
2. **State over decoration**: We don't expose rainbow modes or breathing effects. The LEDs serve a purpose: communicate device state.
3. **One brightness to rule them all**: Users think holistically. They don't want to individually dim 7 LEDs.
4. **Master switch matters**: Some users need zero light pollution. The toggle must be absolute—when off, truly off.
5. **Familiar colors**: Default to universal conventions (red = recording, orange = warning). Allow customization, but start with what works.
