<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "The device should know itself." System settings are about identity and self-awareness—giving the device a name, monitoring its health, managing its resources. We nest complexity (Storage, Performance, Updates) to keep the top level clean.
</Callout>

## Identity First

The most fundamental system setting is **Device Name**. This is how the device identifies itself on the network, in the app's device list, and in logs.

**Default**: `distiller-b515` (model + serial)

**Why it matters**: When you have multiple Distiller devices, "My Office Brain" is more meaningful than "distiller-b515."

**The philosophy**: Make it personal. The device is a member of your digital ecosystem, not a serial number.

## The Nested Structure

System settings follow a hierarchical architecture:

```
System
├── Device Name (top level)
└── System Management
    ├── Storage
    ├── Performance
    └── Updates
```

**Why nest?** These are all "system" concerns, but they serve different user intents:
- **Storage**: "How full is my device?"
- **Performance**: "Is it running well?"
- **Updates**: "Is it current?"

Grouping them under "System Management" signals: *"These are about the device's health, not your project settings."*

## What's Automatic

### Timezone

**Why excluded**: The device infers timezone from Wi-Fi geolocation. When you connect to a network, the device knows where it is. No manual dropdowns of "America/Los_Angeles" or "Europe/Berlin."

**The exception**: If the user wants to override (remote server in a different timezone), we can expose this later. For now, automatic is better.

### Language

**Why excluded**: The Distiller OS currently operates in English. When we support multi-language, it will be automatic based on the user's phone locale, not a per-device setting.

**The philosophy**: Don't expose settings for features that don't exist yet. Wait until the need is real.

## Storage (Nested)

See [Storage settings documentation](/docs/storage) for full details.

**Summary**: Auto-cleanup logs, clear cache on boot, and a visual storage meter. Users want to know "Am I running out of space?" and "Can the device clean up after itself?"

---

## Performance (Nested)

See [Performance settings documentation](/docs/performance) for full details.

**Summary**: A monitoring dashboard (CPU, memory, temperature, uptime, load) with one control: Power Mode (Power Saving / Balanced / Performance). Users want transparency, not tinkering.

---

## Updates (Nested)

See [Updates settings documentation](/docs/updates) for full details.

**Summary**: Auto-check for updates, manual "Check Now" button, and version display. Users want to stay current without manual hunting.

## States of Mind

How users interact with system settings based on their needs.

| User Intent | Action Path |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"I want to name my device"** | System → Device Name |
| **"How much storage is left?"** | System → Storage |
| **"Is the device overheating?"** | System → Performance → Temperature |
| **"Am I on the latest version?"** | System → Updates |

## Design Principles

1. **Identity is top-level**: Device name is immediately visible. It's the most common system setting users change.
2. **Nest complexity**: Storage, Performance, and Updates are important but not daily-use settings. Tucking them under "System Management" keeps the main settings list uncluttered.
3. **Automatic over manual**: Timezone and language should be invisible. If the device can figure it out, don't ask the user.
4. **Health, not configuration**: System settings are about monitoring and light maintenance, not deep OS tweaking. We're not exposing kernel parameters or boot flags.
