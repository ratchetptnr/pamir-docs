title: Onboarding
description: Step-by-step onboarding flow — from app launch to projects page.
---

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

The full first-launch experience. Covers every screen the user sees from opening the app for the first time to landing on the projects page.

**Presentation:** Full-screen flow. This is the only device setup flow that isn't a sheet.

**Steps:**
```
Welcome → Sign In → Device Pairing → WiFi Setup → Claude Setup → Setup Complete
```

**Global rules that apply to every screen:**
- All CTA buttons use system prominent capsule style (Liquid Glass on iOS 26). Consistent sizing and vertical positioning — the button never jumps between screens.
- Haptic feedback on every primary action: selection haptics for toggles, impact haptics for navigation, notification haptics for errors.
- Back button follows standard iOS behavior.

**Fallback checkpoints:** The flow has two recovery points. If something fails, the user falls back to the nearest checkpoint — never to the beginning.

| Failure | Checkpoint | What happens |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BLE connection lost** (at any point) | → **Step 3: Device Pairing** | User re-scans QR or re-enters code to re-establish BLE |
| **WiFi fails** (wrong password, timeout, etc.) | → **Step 4: WiFi Setup** | User stays in / returns to WiFi screens to retry |

---

## Step 1: Welcome

The first screen the user sees. Sets the tone and handles legal compliance.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-welcome.png"
    alt="Welcome screen"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Headline** | "Welcome to Pamir" (or product-appropriate welcome copy) |
| **Subhead** | Brief value proposition |
| **CTA** | "Continue" — navigates to sign-in |
| **Fine print** | "By continuing, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy" — below the CTA button. Both are tappable links. |
| **Back button** | None (first screen) |

---

## Step 2: Sign In

Standard Apple/Google authentication.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-signin.png"
    alt="Sign in screen"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Options** | Sign in with Apple, Sign in with Google |
| **Behavior** | Tapping either button opens an in-app Safari sheet for the auth provider. User completes sign-in in the Safari sheet, which dismisses automatically on success. |
| **On success** | App creates or fetches the user's account, then checks for registered devices |

**After sign-in:**

| Condition | What happens |
| :--- | :--- |
| Account has registered devices | Skip the entire onboarding flow → **Projects page** |
| Account has no devices | → **Step 3: Device Pairing** |

---

## Step 3: Device Pairing (QR Scanner)

Full-screen camera view for scanning the QR code on the device's e-ink display. Dark scrim over the camera feed.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-pairing-scanning.png"
    alt="QR scanner — scanning state"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Layout

| Element | Position | Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User email** | Nav bar (centered) | Shows the signed-in user's email |
| **"Not you?"** | Nav bar (trailing) | Button to switch accounts without leaving the scanner. For the case where someone picks up the wrong phone during group setup. |
| **QR viewfinder** | Center | Corner frame overlay on camera feed. No placeholder graphic — clean scanning surface. |
| **Torch toggle** | Below viewfinder | Native circular toggle button for flashlight. Useful when QR on e-ink is hard to scan in dim light. |
| **"Enter code manually"** | Bottom | Text link — opens manual code entry half-sheet |
| **"Skip"** | Below "Enter code manually" | Text link — skips pairing entirely, goes straight to projects page with empty state (no devices). User can pair later from Settings > Account. |

### QR Frame States

The QR frame itself communicates connection state. All transitions are animated.

| State | Frame | Content inside frame |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scanning** | White frame | Empty (camera feed visible) |
| **Connecting** | Dimmed frame | Spinner + "Connecting to Distiller-8X29..." |
| **Connected** | Green frame | Checkmark |
| **Failed** | Orange frame | "Couldn't connect. Make sure your Distiller is powered on and nearby." |

<div className="flex justify-center gap-4 my-8 flex-wrap">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-pairing-connecting.png"
    alt="QR scanner — connecting state"
    className="w-full max-w-[200px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-pairing-connected.png"
    alt="QR scanner — connected state"
    className="w-full max-w-[200px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-pairing-failed.png"
    alt="QR scanner — failed state"
    className="w-full max-w-[200px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

**On "Connected":** Brief pause (checkmark visible for ~1s), then auto-navigates to → **Step 4: WiFi Setup**.

**On "Failed":** Single action — "Scan again" link below the frame. Resets scanner to scanning state.

---

## Step 3b: Manual Code Entry

Half-sheet presented over the QR scanner. For when scanning won't work (bright lighting, damaged QR, etc.).

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-manual-code.png"
    alt="Manual code entry"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Input field** | Capsule-shaped, 4-digit code, auto-capitalization on |
| **Keyboard icon** | Decorative, with bounce animation on sheet appear |
| **CTA** | "Connect" button — dismisses sheet, QR frame transitions to "Connecting" state → same flow as QR scan |

---

## Step 4: WiFi Setup

After BLE pairing, the app needs to get the device on WiFi.

**If the device already has WiFi credentials** (migration from v2.1.1): the app silently verifies connectivity in the background. If WiFi works, this entire step is skipped — the user goes straight to **Step 5: Claude Code Setup**. If verification fails (network gone, password changed, etc.), the user lands on the network list below as if it were a fresh device.

**If the device has no WiFi credentials** (fresh setup): the device scans for nearby networks and the app displays them.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-wifi-list.png"
    alt="WiFi network list"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Layout

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Nav title** | "Connect Distiller to Wi-Fi" |
| **Section header** | "Available Networks" |
| **Network rows** | WiFi icon + network name + lock icon (if secured) + chevron. Matches system WiFi settings appearance. |
| **"Other Network..."** | Plus icon + text link below the network list — opens manual SSID entry |
| **Back button** | Standard iOS back to pairing screen |

**On tap:** Navigates to → **Step 4b: WiFi Password** for the selected network.

### Edge case: No networks found

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-wifi-empty.png"
    alt="WiFi list — no networks found"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

The network list is empty. A spinner next to "Available Networks" indicates the device is still scanning. "Other Network..." remains available so the user can enter an SSID manually. The device re-scans automatically on a timer.

---

## Step 4b: WiFi Password

Bottom sheet presented over the network list. User enters the password for the selected network.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-wifi-password.png"
    alt="WiFi password entry"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **WiFi icon** | Animated blue WiFi symbol |
| **Headline** | "Join \"[Network Name]\"" — user knows which network they're joining |
| **Subtitle** | "Enter the password to connect your Distiller to this network." |
| **Password field** | Capsule-shaped input with eye toggle (show/hide password). Critical — WiFi passwords are often long and error-prone. |
| **Toolbar** | X (cancel) and checkmark (submit) — checkmark sends credentials to device via BLE |
| **On submit** | Sheet stays open, WiFi icon animates while connecting |

### Connection results

The user stays on this sheet while the device attempts WiFi. No separate screen.

| Result | What happens |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Success** | Brief checkmark animation → auto-navigates to → **Step 5: Claude Code Setup** |
| **Wrong password** | Inline error in password sheet. Field clears and refocuses. After 2 failed attempts, show helper text: "Password is case-sensitive." Notification haptic on each failure. |
| **Timeout (30s)** | Show options: "Try Again" (resend same credentials) or "Different Network" (back to network list) |

---

## Step 4c: Manual WiFi Entry

Sheet presented when the user taps "Other Network..." on the WiFi list. User enters the network name and password manually.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-manual-wifi.png"
    alt="Manual WiFi entry"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **WiFi icon** | Blue WiFi symbol |
| **Headline** | "Join Wi-Fi Network" |
| **Grouped form** | Name and Password fields in a single rounded card |
| **Toolbar** | X (cancel) and checkmark (submit) — same behavior as Step 4b |

---

## Step 5: Claude Code Setup

Single-page provider setup. User connects their Anthropic account so Claude works on the device.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-claude-setup.png"
    alt="Claude Code setup screen"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Layout

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Icon** | Claude logo |
| **Headline** | "Connect Claude Code" |
| **Subtitle** | "Connect your Anthropic account to use Claude on [device name]" — device name always visible so user knows what they're configuring |
| **CTA** | "Setup" — opens OAuth sheet |
| **Skip** | "I'll do this later" text link — skips directly to → **Step 6: Setup Complete** |

### Button States

This is a **single page** — connecting and ready states are handled inline via button transitions, not separate screens.

| State | Button | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Idle** | "Setup" | Tappable. Opens an in-app Safari sheet for Anthropic OAuth. |
| **Authenticating** | (OAuth sheet is open) | User signs in on Anthropic's website and authorizes Distiller. |
| **Connecting** | Spinner replaces button text | OAuth sheet closed. App sending credentials to device via BLE. |
| **Ready** | Green checkmark replaces spinner | Brief pause (~1s) then auto-navigates to → **Step 6** |
| **Failed** | "Try Again" + "Skip" | OAuth failed or device config failed. User can retry or skip. |

<Callout>
  **No free trial option.** Claude requires the user's own Anthropic subscription. One action, no decision fatigue.
</Callout>

---

## Step 6: Setup Complete

The final screen before the user enters the app.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-complete.png"
    alt="Setup complete screen"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Layout

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Visual** | Distiller mascot image (not a generic checkmark) |
| **Headline** | "[Device Name] is ready!" |
| **Subtitle** | "You're all set. Let's get started." |
| **CTA** | "Go to [Device Name]" — navigates to → **Projects page** |
| **Back button** | Hidden. No going back from completion. |

### Migration variant

| Element | Change |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Headline** | "Your Distiller is updated!" instead of "ready" |
| **Everything else** | Same |

---

## → Projects Page

Onboarding is done. The user lands on the projects page with their newly registered device active.

If the user **skipped pairing** at Step 3, they land on the projects page in an empty state — no devices, with a prompt to add one from Settings > Account.

---

## Error Alerts

These are system alerts that can appear at any point in the flow after BLE pairing.

### BLE Connection Lost

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-alert-ble-lost.png"
    alt="BLE connection lost alert"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Title** | "Connection Lost" |
| **Message** | "The connection to your Distiller was lost. You'll need to scan the QR code again." |
| **Action** | "Start Over" — falls back to Step 3 (Device Pairing) |

### WiFi Connection Timed Out

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/onboarding-alert-wifi-timeout.png"
    alt="WiFi timeout alert"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

| Element | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Title** | "Connection Timed Out" |
| **Message** | "Your Distiller couldn't connect to this network." |
| **Primary action** | "Try Again" — resends the same credentials |
| **Secondary action** | "Different Network" — dismisses sheet, back to network list |

---

## Error Summary

Every error has a clear path forward. No dead ends.
