title: Add Device
description: Adding a new device from the main app — same pairing flow, presented as a sheet.
---

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

Adding a device after the user is already signed in and using the app. This is the same core flow as [Onboarding](/docs/build/ios/onboarding) Steps 3–6, but presented as a sheet instead of a full-screen flow.

**Entry point:** Settings > Account > Add Device

**Presentation:** Full-height sheet over the main app. Not a full-screen flow.

**Steps:**
```
Device Pairing → WiFi Setup → Claude Setup → Setup Complete
```

<Callout>
  This flow reuses the same screens as onboarding. This page only documents the **differences**. For full screen details (QR frame states, WiFi password sheet, connection results, error alerts, etc.), see [Onboarding](/docs/build/ios/onboarding).
</Callout>

## Differences from Onboarding

| | Onboarding | Add Device |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Presentation** | Full-screen flow | Sheet over the main app |
| **Auth** | User must sign in first (Steps 1–2) | Already signed in — skipped |
| **QR scanner nav bar** | User email (centered) + "Not you?" button | No email, no "Not you?" — user is already authenticated |
| **Skip option on pairing** | "Skip" text link — goes to empty projects page | Not available — user chose to add a device, no reason to skip |
| **Setup Complete headline** | "[Device Name] is ready!" | "[Device Name] is ready!" (same) |
| **Setup Complete CTA** | "Go to [Device Name]" → Projects page | "Done" — dismisses the sheet |
| **Back button** | Standard iOS back | Standard iOS back. On the first screen (QR scanner), back dismisses the sheet entirely. |
| **Fallback checkpoints** | Same | Same — BLE lost → back to pairing, WiFi fails → stays in WiFi screens |
| **Error alerts** | Same | Same — "Connection Lost" and "Connection Timed Out" alerts work identically |

## Flow

### Step 1: Device Pairing (QR Scanner)

Same as [Onboarding Step 3](/docs/build/ios/onboarding#step-3-device-pairing-qr-scanner), with these changes:

| Element | Change from onboarding |
| :--- | :--- |
| **User email** | Not shown |
| **"Not you?"** | Not shown |
| **"Skip"** | Not shown |
| **"Enter code manually"** | Same — opens manual code entry half-sheet |
| **Torch toggle** | Same |
| **QR frame states** | Same (Scanning → Connecting → Connected → Failed) |

### Step 2: WiFi Setup

Same as [Onboarding Step 4](/docs/build/ios/onboarding#step-4-wifi-setup). No changes.

### Step 3: Claude Code Setup

Same as [Onboarding Step 5](/docs/build/ios/onboarding#step-5-claude-code-setup). No changes.

### Step 4: Setup Complete

Same as [Onboarding Step 6](/docs/build/ios/onboarding#step-6-setup-complete), except:

| Element | Change from onboarding |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CTA** | "Done" — dismisses the sheet (instead of "Go to [Device Name]") |

After dismissal, the main app should have the new device available in the device selector.
