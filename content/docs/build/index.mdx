description: Screen-by-screen implementation handoffs for frontend developers.

This tab contains implementation specs — what to build, screen by screen. Each doc is a self-contained handoff: shared components documented once, per-flow differences called out explicitly.

For design rationale, flowcharts, and architecture decisions, see the Architecture tab.
