<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "The right alert at the right time." Notifications are not about device sounds—the Distiller doesn't chime. Notifications are **push alerts to your phone** when the AI agent needs your input or when the device's health is at risk.
</Callout>

## The Remote IDE Model

Distiller is a remote IDE. The device runs AI agents that write code, manage projects, and interact with the world. The phone is the controller—the way you see what's happening and intervene when needed.

**Key insight**: Notifications bridge the gap between the autonomous agent (Distiller) and the supervising human (you) when physical proximity isn't guaranteed.

## Notification Types

### 1. AI Agent Requests

**What triggers it**: The AI agent needs user input, permissions, or a decision to continue its work.

**Examples**:
- *"Should I install this npm package?"*
- *"This code change requires sudo. Approve?"*
- *"Project build failed. Review error log?"*

**Why it matters**: The agent is autonomous, but not omnipotent. When it hits a decision point requiring human judgment, it can't proceed silently. The notification is a tap on the shoulder: *"I need you."*

**Always enabled**: This is the core use case. You can't disable agent requests. If you did, the agent would be stuck waiting forever, and you'd never know.

### 2. Device Health Alerts

These are critical warnings about the device's physical state.

#### Temperature Alerts

**What triggers it**: CPU temperature > 70°C

**Why it matters**: Raspberry Pi throttles at high temps. If the device is in direct sunlight, a poorly ventilated enclosure, or running a CPU-heavy task, you need to know before it shuts down.

**The toggle**: On/Off (default: On)

**Example notification**: *"Distiller temperature is high (78°C). Check ventilation."*

#### Storage Alerts

**What triggers it**: Disk usage > 85%

**Why it matters**: Out-of-storage errors are silent killers. The device can't save files, log data, or install dependencies. A proactive alert gives users time to clean up before failure.

**The toggle**: On/Off (default: On)

**Example notification**: *"Distiller storage is nearly full (89%). Free up space."*

## What We Excluded (and Why)

These notification types exist in other systems but were deliberately excluded.

| Notification Type | Why Excluded |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sound Notifications** | The device doesn't chime. Notifications are push alerts to your phone, not speakers on the device. |
| **LED Notifications** | LEDs are covered in [LED settings](/docs/led). They're ambient indicators, not notification alerts. |
| **Memory Alerts** | Too technical. Storage and temperature are user-actionable. Memory is not—users can't "free up RAM" easily. |
| **Network Alerts** | Low value, high noise. Wi-Fi drops and reconnects are handled automatically (see [WiFi documentation](/docs/wifi)). |

## The Notification Flow

1. **Trigger Event**: Agent needs input OR device health issue occurs
2. **Server Push**: Distiller sends notification payload to cloud
3. **Phone Receives**: iOS notification appears (banner, lock screen, notification center)
4. **User Taps**: Opens app, navigates to relevant screen (agent chat, performance dashboard, storage)

**Actionable**: Notifications aren't just alerts—they're shortcuts. Tapping takes you directly to where you need to act.

---

## How It Works (Push Notifications)

Notifications work even when the app is closed or the phone is locked.

**The technology**: Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)

**The flow**:
- Distiller → Cloud Server → APNs → Your Phone

**User perception**: *"My phone buzzes. I see: 'Agent needs approval to install package X.' I tap, approve, and the agent continues."*

## States of Mind

How users configure notifications based on their workflow.

| User Scenario | Settings Pattern |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"I want to know everything"** | Temp Alerts: On, Storage Alerts: On |
| **"I'm near the device, don't need phone alerts"** | Temp Alerts: Off, Storage Alerts: Off (monitor via app) |
| **"I only care about agent requests"** | Temp Alerts: Off, Storage Alerts: Off (agent requests always on) |
| **"I'm debugging and don't want distractions"** | Temp Alerts: Off, but Storage: On (out-of-space will break builds) |

## Design Principles

1. **Agent requests are sacred**: You can't disable them. They're the reason the notification system exists.
2. **Health alerts are optional**: Temperature and storage warnings are helpful but not mandatory. Users who actively monitor the app can turn them off.
3. **Actionable, not informational**: Every notification has a clear action. "Temperature high" → Check ventilation or reduce workload. "Agent needs approval" → Approve or deny.
4. **Phone is the interface**: Notifications are the bridge between the autonomous device and the human supervisor. They're not device sounds or LED blinks—they're push messages to your pocket.
5. **No noise**: We don't send trivial notifications (battery percentage, Wi-Fi signal strength). Only things that require human action or awareness.
