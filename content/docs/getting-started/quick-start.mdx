### Boot & Ready

When powered on, the device boots and displays a QR code with instructions.

```
┌──────────────────────────┐

│                          │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

The device is ready for setup. It's showing a QR code that links to the Distiller app.

## Connect Your Phone

### Step 1: Scan QR Code

**What to do on your phone:**
1. Open the Camera app
2. Point at the QR code on your Distiller's screen
3. Tap the notification to open the Distiller app

**Device Display:**
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│                          │
│   [QR CODE]              │
│                          │
│   Connecting to phone... │
│                          │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**App Display:**

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/01-welcome.png"
    alt="App welcome screen - ready to discover device"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Step 2: App Finds Your Device

**What happens automatically:**
- App opens and searches for your Distiller via Bluetooth
- Finds your device and shows it in the list of nearby devices

**App Display:**

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/02-ble-searching.png"
    alt="App found Distiller - tap to connect via Bluetooth"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

**What to do:** Tap your Distiller's name to connect.

---

## Secure Your Device

Your device is now connected to the app via Bluetooth. Now you'll set it up.

### Step 3: Name Your Device

Give your Distiller a memorable name so you can identify it later.

**Device Display:**
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│                          │
│   [QR CODE]              │
│                          │
│   Setting up...          │
│                          │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

**App Display:**

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/03-secure-device.png"
    alt="App screen - set device name and password"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

**What to do:**
1. Enter a name (e.g., "My Distiller" or "Studio Bot")
2. Tap Next

### Step 4: Set Device Password

Create a password to protect your device. You'll need this password if you ever need to recover or change settings.

**What to do:**
1. Create a strong password (minimum 6 characters, but 8+ recommended)
2. Confirm the password
3. Tap Save

**Why both name and password?**
- **Name** = Device identification (which physical device is this?)
- **Password** = Device authorization (who can change settings?)

This is like naming and locking your iPhone.
