## Power On & Boot

Your Distiller boots up and is ready to be set up.

### Boot & Ready

When powered on, the device boots and displays a QR code and a 4-digit pairing code.

**Device Display:**
```

└──────────────────────────┘
```

The device is ready for setup. The QR code links to the Distiller app. The 4-digit code is a fallback for manual pairing.

## Connect Your Phone & Sign In

### Step 1: Scan QR Code & Sign In

**What to do on your phone:**
1. Open the Camera app
2. Point at the QR code on your Distiller's screen
3. Tap the notification to open the Distiller app
4. On the Welcome screen, tap **Continue with Apple** or **Continue with Google**

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/01-welcome.png"
    alt="App welcome screen with Sign-In options"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Step 2: Pair Your Device

After signing in, the app shows a pairing screen. You have two options:

1. **Scan the QR code again** — this time using the in-app scanner to identify your specific device
2. **Enter the 4-digit code** shown on your Distiller's screen (e.g. `8X29`)

Once the device is identified, the app automatically connects via Bluetooth.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/ios/02-device-pairing.png"
    alt="App pairing screen with QR scanner and code entry"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

**What to do:** Point your phone at the QR code, or type the 4-digit code and tap **Connect**.

## Connect to WiFi

Your device is now paired to your account. Now it's time to get it online.

### Step 3: Select WiFi Network

**What happens:**
1. App requests WiFi network list from device via Bluetooth
2. Device scans nearby networks and sends list back to app
3. App displays available networks

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/04-wifi-list.png"
    alt="App showing WiFi networks - select your network"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

**What to do:**
1. Find your WiFi network in the list
2. Tap to select it

### Step 4: Enter WiFi Password & Connect

**What happens:**
1. App displays password entry screen
2. You enter your WiFi password
3. App sends credentials to device via Bluetooth
4. Device attempts to connect to WiFi

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/app/06-wifi-connecting.png"
    alt="App shows connecting - device is attempting WiFi"
    className="w-full max-w-[320px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

**What to do:**
1. Enter your WiFi password
2. Tap "Connect"
3. Wait for the device to connect
