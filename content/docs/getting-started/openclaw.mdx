  OpenClaw was previously called **Clawdbot** and briefly **Moltbot**. Same service, different names.

## Step 1: Power the Device

The Distiller has two USB-C ports on its side. The **power port** is the one **farthest from you** when facing the device, closest to the display.

Plug a USB-C cable into that port and connect it to a power source.

<div className="flex justify-center my-8">

    alt="Distiller powered on with USB-C plugged into the power port"
    className="w-full max-w-[400px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

<Callout type="warn">
  Use the correct port. The second USB-C port (closer to you) is for data — plugging power into the wrong port won't boot the device.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Connect to the Distiller's Hotspot

Once the device boots, the display enters **Setup Mode** showing:

- **SSID**: the device's WiFi hotspot name (e.g. `Distiller-A412`)
- **QR code**: scan to connect instantly
- **URL**: the captive portal address (e.g. `http://distiller-a412.local:8080`)

The hotspot is an open network — no password required.

{/* TODO: Replace with final image */}
<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/getting-started/openclaw-setup-mode.png"
    alt="Distiller display in Setup Mode showing SSID, QR code, and captive portal URL"
    className="w-full rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

On your phone or laptop:

1. **Scan the QR code** on the display to connect automatically
2. Or open your WiFi settings and search for the SSID (e.g. `Distiller-A412`)

## Step 3: Configure WiFi

Once connected to the hotspot, a **captive portal** opens in your browser. If it doesn't, navigate to the URL shown on the device display.

The captive portal lists all WiFi networks the Distiller can detect nearby.

{/* TODO: Replace with final image */}
<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/getting-started/openclaw-captive-portal.png"
    alt="Captive portal showing nearby WiFi networks"
    className="w-full max-w-[400px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

1. **Tap the WiFi network** you want the Distiller to connect to
2. **Enter the password** for that network
3. The Distiller connects and establishes its own internet connection

<Callout type="info">
  After the Distiller connects to WiFi, it disconnects from its setup hotspot. Your phone/laptop will automatically rejoin your regular network.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Open the OpenClaw Dashboard

The display changes to **Connected** and shows:

- **OpenClaw Access**: IP address and port (e.g. `192.168.8.153:18789`)
- **OpenClaw Password**: gateway password (e.g. `clwdbt-s3tup`)
- **Network**: the WiFi network your Distiller is on
- **QR code**: scan to open the dashboard

{/* TODO: Replace with final image */}
<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/getting-started/openclaw-connected.png"
    alt="Distiller display showing Connected status with OpenClaw access IP, password, and QR code"
    className="w-full rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

Scan the QR code, or type the IP address into your browser. This works from any device on the same WiFi — phone, tablet, or desktop.

## Step 5: Authenticate with Gateway Access

1. Go to **Overview > Gateway Access**
2. Enter the **OpenClaw Password** shown on the device display into the **Password** field
3. Click **Connect**

    alt="OpenClaw dashboard — Gateway Access password field"
    className="w-full rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

## Step 6: Add Your AI Provider API Key

OpenClaw needs an API key from an AI provider. You can use **Anthropic (Claude)**, **OpenAI**, or both.

### Getting Your API Keys

<Callout>
  You'll need your own account with the provider. OpenClaw does not include API credits.
</Callout>

| Provider | How to Get a Key |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | Go to [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) — create an account, add billing, then generate an API key. See [Anthropic's quickstart guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup). |
| **OpenAI** | Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) — sign in, add billing, then create a new secret key. See [OpenAI's quickstart guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart). |

### Adding Keys to OpenClaw

1. Go to **Config > Environment > All**
2. Scroll down to **Custom entries**
3. Click **+ Add Entry**
4. Add your key(s):

| Name | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Your Anthropic API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key |

You can add one or both.

    alt="Config > Environment > Custom entries with API key fields"
    className="w-full rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

5. Click **Save**

<Callout type="warn">
  Don't skip this. You'll see an "unsaved change" banner — your keys won't take effect until you click **Save**.
</Callout>

## Step 7: Test Your Setup

Open the **Chat** tab in the OpenClaw dashboard and send a test message. If the AI responds, your Distiller is set up and ready to use.

{/* TODO: Replace with final image */}
<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img

    alt="OpenClaw Chat tab with a test message and AI response"
    className="w-full rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

If you don't get a response, double-check that:
- Your API key is correct and has billing enabled
- You clicked **Save** after adding the key
- The Distiller is connected to the internet (check the device display)

## Telegram Setup

You can also talk to your Distiller through Telegram. This is optional but lets you chat from anywhere — no need to be on the same WiFi network.

### Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**

{/* TODO: Replace with final image */}
<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/getting-started/tg-botfather-search.png"
    alt="Searching for @BotFather in Telegram"
    className="w-full max-w-[400px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

2. Send `/newbot`
3. BotFather asks for two things:
   - **Name**: a display name for your bot (e.g. `DistillerBot`)
   - **Username**: a unique handle that must end in `bot` (e.g. `Distiller_123_bot`) — this is what you'll search for later

{/* TODO: Replace with final image */}
<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/getting-started/tg-botfather-newbot.png"
    alt="BotFather conversation — sending /newbot, choosing a name and username, receiving the bot token"
    className="w-full max-w-[400px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

4. BotFather replies with a **bot token** (looks like `8506960630:AAG_yVQ22Wc4j...`) — copy it

### Step 2: Add the Token to OpenClaw

1. In the OpenClaw dashboard, go to **Channels**
2. Scroll down to the **Telegram** section
3. Paste your bot token into the **Telegram Bot Token** field

{/* TODO: Replace with final image */}
<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/getting-started/tg-token-field.png"
    alt="OpenClaw Channels page — Telegram Bot Token field"
    className="w-full rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

4. Scroll down to the bottom of the Telegram section and click **Save**

<Callout type="warn">
  The **Save** button is at the very bottom of the Telegram section. You'll need to scroll past several other fields to find it.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Start the Bot

1. In Telegram, search for the **username** you gave your bot (e.g. `Distiller_123_bot`)
2. Open the chat and tap **Start**
3. The bot replies with your **Telegram user ID** — copy it

{/* TODO: Replace with final image */}
<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/getting-started/tg-bot-start.png"
    alt="Telegram bot chat — tapping Start and receiving user ID"
    className="w-full max-w-[400px] rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

### Step 4: Allowlist Your User ID

1. Back in the OpenClaw dashboard, go to **Channels > Telegram**
2. Find the **Allow From** section and click **+ Add**
3. Paste your **Telegram user ID** into the field

{/* TODO: Replace with final image */}
<div className="flex justify-center my-8">
  <img
    src="/docs/getting-started/tg-allow-from.png"
    alt="OpenClaw Channels — Telegram Allow From field with user ID"
    className="w-full rounded-2xl border shadow-xl"
  />
</div>

4. Scroll down and click **Save**

### Step 5: Verify

Go back to your bot in Telegram and send a message. If the AI responds, Telegram is connected and your Distiller is fully set up.
