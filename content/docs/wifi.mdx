<Callout title="Product Philosophy">
  "The device must be self-healing." We assume Wi-Fi connectivity is ephemeral and fragile. The system is designed to provide a secure, frustration-free recovery path even when the device is completely offline and "headless".
</Callout>

## Recovery Flow

This diagram shows how the device transitions from online to offline states and how the BLE bridge enables recovery.

## The Recovery Journey

### 1. The Stable State
In the ideal state, the device is invisible. It maintains a persistent websocket connection to our servers.
- **Device**: Quietly hums, displaying system vitals.
- **App**: Shows a green "Online" indicator. User trusts the link is alive.

### 2. The Loss (Entropy)
Wi-Fi is lost. Maybe the router restarted, the password changed, or the device moved to a new office.
- **The Philosophy**: Do not panic immediately. Transients happen. The device retries silently for 2 minutes.
- **The Escalation**: If the silence persists, the device declares a "Hard Offline" state. It switches its E-ink display to a distress signal: a large QR code.

### 3. The Bridge (BLE)
This is the critical "Voice of the User" moment. The user sees the distress signal (Physical E-ink or App Alert) and intervenes.
- **Why BLE?**: Accessing a headless device without Wi-Fi is impossible via standard means. BLE provides a secure, local "side-channel" to inject new credentials.
- **The Interaction**: The user is near the device. The app creates a secure tunnel over BLE. The device effectively uses the phone's eyes to see the world (scanning networks).

### 4. The Restoration
The user selects a new network on their phone.
- **The Handover**: Credentials are encrypted and passed through the BLE tunnel.
- **The Verification**: The device attempts to connect while the user watches.
- **Success**: The BLE bridge is dismantled. The device returns to the Stable State.

## Key Design Behaviors

| Behavior | Logic & "Why" |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Auto-Discovery** | When offline, the device must shout. It enables Bluetooth advertising automatically so the app can find it without the user pressing physical buttons (which might not exist or be reachable). |
| **Credential Persistence** | **Smart Cache**. If the device moves back to a known location (Home -> Office -> Home), it shouldn't ask for help. It checks its cache first. Respect the user's time. |
| **Security** | **Trust, but Verify**. Even over BLE, we must prevent "drive-by" reconfigurations by neighbors. We require the device-specific Password (set at onboarding) to establish the bridge. |
| **Stateless Recovery** | The QR code is a permanent "Reset" button. Whether online or offline, scanning it triggers the recovery flow. The user should never feel "stuck" in a bad state. |

## States of Mind

We map the technical states to the user's perception of the device.

### Device (E-ink Display)
| State | User Perception | Information Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stable** | "It's working." | Show value (Dashboard, IP). Don't distract. |
| **Transient** | "It's thinking." | Reassurance ("Reconnecting..."). Don't alarm yet. |
| **Hard Offline** | "I need help." | Call to Action. The QR code must be the dominant visual element. |
| **Provisioning** | "I'm listening." | Feedback. "Connecting to [SSID]...". Show effort. |

### Mobile App (The Controller)
| State | User Role | Interface Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stable** | Observer | Green light. Everything is nominal. |
| **Warning** | Monitor | Yellow light. "Weak connection". Prepare for intervention. |
| **Offline** | Rescuer | Red light. "Action Required". Guide user to the device. |
| **BLE Bridge** | Operator | The Controller. The app is now the device's brain. Clean, step-by-step wizard. |

## The Safety Net (Failure Handling)

What happens when even the recovery fails? (e.g., Wrong password, Captive Portal).

**The Auto-Hotspot Fallback**
If the configuration fails (e.g., user enters wrong Wi-Fi password over BLE), the device does not silently die. It:
1.  Reports the error over BLE if still connected.
2.  If BLE disconnects, it **Reverts to Hotspot Mode**.
3.  The App detects the hotspot and prompts: *"That didn't work. Try a different network?"*

**Why?**
We never leave the user in a dead end. Every failure state must loop back to an actionable state (Manual Entry or Select Network).
